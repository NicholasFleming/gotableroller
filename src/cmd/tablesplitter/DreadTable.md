# 1,000 ABNORMAL GHOULS

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 


1. This foul beast wears blood-spattered once-fine clothes.
2. One of the creature's ears is missing—all that remains is a livid red scar.
3. More emaciated than its fellows, the claws on this creature's left hand are broken.
4. With but one eye, this ghoul looks almost comical; however, its remaining eye blazes with hate and hunger.
5. Tufts of blond hair cling to the creature's scalp.
6. Dried blood coats the creature's chin and chest.
7. Still wearing torn and bloody clothes, this creature only has one boot; its other foot is little more than a stump— its toes seemingly gnawed away.
8. The creature clutches the shard of a jagged sword in its right hand and licks the weapon's splintered blade as it stalks forward.
9. This creature's neck is laid open—the white glimmer of its spine is visible behind its writhing muscles and pallid, shrivelled skin.
10. Bizarrely elongated ears—perhaps reminiscent of an elf's —grow from this horrid creature's head. 

## BATTLE TACTICS 

1. This starving ghoul immediately feasts on any slain combatant—even one of its own—and only resumes fighting if attacked.
2. The ghoul stays low and goes for its opponent's legs, in an attempt to trip its target.
3. The ghoul screeches as it rushes into combat and loudly howls every time it injures its prey.
4. As it stalks forward, this ghoul licks dried blood from its chin with its elongated, blackened tongue.
5. Clutching two skulls, which it uses as improved missile weapons, the ghoul skirts combat in an attempt to get at the party's (soft-skinned and vulnerable) spellcasters.
6. This ghoul unhesitatingly attacks the nearest opponent.
7. This ghoul is ravenous. If it downs an opponent, it immediately drags it away to feast in private.
8. Stronger than its fellow, this ghoul grapples and pins its opponent so its allies may feast on living prey.
9. This ghoul has a dim recollection of its previous life. If it finds a discarded weapon, it uses it in battle.
10. This ghoul is a rarity of its kind. It is a coward and flees if the battle seems lost. If captured, it is very talkative if it seems cooperation may save its “life”. 

## TREASURE 



1. The ghoul wears a silver earring (worth 5 gp); its twin is missing—long since torn from the creature's ear.
2. Three small bronze rings set with coloured glass— nothing more than costume jewellery—adorn the ghoul's left hand. Each ring is worth 1 sp.
3. The creature wears a belt from which hangs a bloodstained pouch containing 3 gp.
4. The creature was once a thief. Its worn boots contain a hidden compartment in each heel; each holds a single platinum coin (but only perceptive characters find this hidden treasure).
5. In life, this poor unfortunate had a penchant for piercings and wore four small silver bars (each worth 1 gp) in each ear.
6. The ghoul wears a shredded once fine shirt; silver thread (worth 5 gp) decorates its collar and cuffs.
7. Incongruously, in life, this poor fellow had three false gold teeth. If they are extracted—a foul, dangerous task during which the character could contract ghoul fever— they are worth 3 gp (assuming the characters don't confess to where they got the tainted precious metal).
8. The ghoul wears thick, torn trousers. It has a hidden fine silver dagger (worth 90 gp) strapped to its left shin.
9. The creature wears a single gold ring set with a tiny black stone (an onyx) on a broken, swollen finger. The ring (worth 50 gp) can only be removed by cutting off the finger.
10. This creature has a stud piercing its overly-long, blackened tongue. Only a perceptive character searching the body spots the stud (worth 20 gp), which can only be salvaged by removing the tongue. 





#  1,000 ABNORMAL MUMMIES 

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 

1. The creature's crazed eyes—one red and one blue— glimmer balefully.
2. Eldritch symbols cover the wrappings around the creature's head—giving the impression of tattoos.
3. The wrappings around the creature's left leg are loose and unravel as the battle rages.
4. The creature's blackened wrappings are ragged and—in a few places—scorched.
5. Dried blood covers the creature's hands—as if it has bludgeoned more than one foe to death.
6. The heavy, cloying miasma of death radiates from the creature. (Investigation reveals the mummy's body is rotting from the inside out).
7. The creature's eyes have been gouged out, and it is blind; it has excellent hearing, however, and sniffs the air like a hunting hound searching for prey.
8. Large and hulking, the creature lumbers about with no semblance of stealth.
9. The creature's head lolls unnaturally on a broken neck.
10. The creature wears the ornate funeral mask of a priest. 

## BATTLE TACTICS 

1. This mummy mournfully moans and groans as it enters combat. It bellows in anger when damaged.
2. Driven mad by its unlife, this mummy cackles and capers in combat—sometimes wasting actions to do so.
3. Carrying an ornamental falchion into battle, this mummy hews mightily with the blade until reduced to half hit points (at which point, it reverts to its natural attacks).
4. Every time it strikes a foe, the mummy lets out a deep, malevolent laugh.
5. If the mummy knocks a foe unconscious, it spends several rounds battering its helpless enemy to death.
6. Terrified by fire, the mummy cowers away from even the smallest flame.
7. The mummy was a tomb robber; it sneaks about trying to attack with surprise (preferably from behind).
8. The mummy hates followers of good gods. It attacks folk bearing such symbols before all other targets.
9. The mummy grapples its opponents before beating them to death with its mighty fists.
10. Abnormally resistant to fire and flames, being burnt does not scare this mummy. 

## TREASURE 

1. A thick gold bangle worth 50 gp encircles the mummy's left leg.
2. One strip of the mummy's wrappings radiates faint magic. It is a scroll of bless.
3. A +1 arrow fletched with silver feathers is lodged in a fold in the mummy's wrappings.
4. The creature wears ancient tarnished silver earrings of a style not wrought for centuries. They are worth 100 gp but are blasphemous things.
5. The mummy wears the unholy symbol of an evil god of death. Studded with tiny glittering blood-red rubies, the thing is beautiful and terrible. It is worth 350 gp.
6. The mummy's festering burial wrappings are stitched together with silver wire. Removed and cleaned, the wire is worth 75 gp.
7. Ornate jade jars (worth 100 gp) hold the mummy's shrivelled internal organs.
8. The mummy wears an ornate silver pendant adorned with a (now defaced) rising sun symbol. The pendant is only worth 50 gp due to the damage.
9. The herbs replacing the mummy's internal organs are rare and well preserved. They have a special connection to undeath.
10. Jagged shards of transparent dark green stones (bloodstones) replace several of the mummy's teeth. The teeth glimmer in the light. Each gem tooth enables the mummy to cast a minor cleric spell once per day. 





# 1,000 ABNORMAL SKELETONS 

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 

1. Scraps of hair grow from patches of decomposing flesh yet cling to the skeleton's skull.
2. Several bones are missing from the creature's rib cage.
3. The entire left side of the skeleton's skull is crushed and broken—no doubt the result of a massively heavy blow.
4. Dirty, torn rags cling to the skeleton's frame. Covered in matted dirt and dried blood, the rags reek of death and the grave.
5. Ending in a jagged stump, the skeleton's right arm is missing below the elbow.
6. Incongruously, this skeleton's skull—minus its jaw—is wedged inside the creature's ribcage.
7. Clad in faded but serviceable clothes, this skeleton seems more recent animated than its brethren. Its bones are clean—perhaps even polished—and lumps of specially shaped ebon coal fill its eye sockets.
8. One of the skeleton's legs is smashed; the remains of its lower left leg hangs from its kneecap.
9. This skeleton's bones are stained a mottled black. (The skeleton was immersed in oil long ago, which impregnated the bones; it burns easily—and brightly!)
10. This tall skeleton's body is tightly wrapped in strips of mouldering cloth; however, its skull has not been so wrapped. To the uninitiated, the skeleton could appear to be a mummy. 


## BATTLE TACTICS 

1. With one missing leg, this skeleton literally hops into battle. It moves at half speed.
2. This undead is faster than its companions; increase its speed by half.
3. Every time the skeleton lands a successful hit, a few small bones fall away from its body.
4. This skeleton walks loudly. The click-click of its bony feet is audible from a goodly distance.
5. After it first misses in melee, the skeleton drops its weapon and reaches toward its foes with its claw-like bony fingers.
6. Every time it strikes a foe in battle, the skeleton throws back its head in silent exultation.
7. The skeleton carries a large, blood-spattered wooden shield—which it uses to beat its foes to death—strapped to its arm.
8. With no legs, this badly damaged skeleton crawls into battle. It doesn't use a weapon; instead, it tries to rip its target's feet and lower legs to shreds.
9. This skeleton beats its enemies to death with a mouldy arm ripped from a previous victim's corpse.
10. A glimmer of sentience remains in this skeleton. A thief in life, it dimly remembers the worth of striking from behind and manoeuvres accordingly. 

## TREASURE 

1. The skeleton wears a stained broad leather belt that holds up the remains of a ragged pair of trousers. The belt has a secret compartment, which holds 3 platinum coins. (Only perceptive characters find the coins).
2. This skeleton has gold fillings in its teeth; extracting the gold yields 1 gp worth of scrap metal.
3. The hilt of the skeleton's weapon has a small black gem (an onyx worth 15 gp) in its handle.
4. The skeleton wears a leather necklace around its neck. The beaten copper and bronze locket hanging from the necklace is hopelessly wrapped around the skeleton's rib bones.
5. Worn gold coins of ancient design are firmly wedged into the skeleton's eye sockets.
6. Eldritch symbols are etched into one of the skeleton's leg bones. The fell writings are a curse on the living and are worth 2 gp to a collector of such macabre things.
7. A silver-tipped arrow is loosely wedged in the skeleton's bony ribcage.
8. The skeleton wears a small silver ring on its left-hand little finger. The ring has the stylised image of a spread fisherman's net. The ring is worth 2 gp but might belong to a well-to-do local family (and therefore may be worth more to them).
9. Bizarrely, this skeleton wears a ludicrously oversized fur hat sporting a wide brim. The hat is worn, bloodsplattered and essentially worthless; however, an easily found secret pocket in the hat holds a tightly folded scroll of cure light wounds.
10. This skeleton's skull contains a largish iron key wedged into its brain cavity. The key unlocks a nearby door. 





# 1,000 ABNORMAL WIGHTS 

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 

1. One of the creature's arms has lost all its flesh; nothing but gleaming white bone remains.
2. Still clad in ripped and torn furs, this creature had its throat ripped out before it died.
3. The creature's face is horridly decomposed; muscles and sinew can easily be made out through the ruin of its rotting cheeks.
4. The back of this creature's skull is caved in; a putrid mass of dark grey brain is clearly visible.
5. The foul creature's shrivelled throat is horribly blackened and desiccated.
6. Long claw marks run up the creature's legs. The rotting flesh around the wounds is mottled with sullen red splotches and part-healed scars.
7. The creature has suffered a vicious head wound; one of its eyes hangs from its socket and jiggles disconcertingly when the creature moves.
8. This creature's face is locked into a horrible grimace of fear and revulsion.
9. As it advances, this creature begins to weep thick, oozing dark-red tears.
10. This creature's back is a mass of claw and bite marks. The wounds are so deep, gleaming white ribs are visible. 

## BATTLE TACTICS 

1. This wight tries to sneak around the back and prefers to fight weak, unarmored opponents.
2. This wight clutches a spear and hurls it before charging.
3. Before it charges, the creature screams unintelligibly at the top of its lungs.
4. Hungry for flesh, but cautious, this wight fights defensively unless it believes its foe is no real threat.
5. If injured by a melee weapon, the wight tries to rip it from its attacker's hands.
6. If the wight slays an opponent, it immediately feasts on the yet-warm corpse (until it rises to join the undead).
7. This creature has a shattered left leg. It uses a broken spear as a crutch and only moves at half speed.
8. This wight wields a huge two-handed axe. It seeks out the toughest-looking opponent and hacks it to death.
9. Sneaky and cunning, this wight always seeks a flanking position, in battle.
10. This wight tries to rip a defender's shield from its target's hand. If successful, it uses the shield as a missile weapon. 

## TREASURE 

1. Four golden rings gleam on the fingers of this wight's right hand. Three are plain (worth 20 gp each). The fourth is a signet ring (worth 50 gp) and bears a rampant swan sigil.
2. This wight yet wears a belt with a pouch attached. The pouch holds a score of marbles and a set of slender lock picks in their own small supple leather pouch.
3. The wight has a sheathed dagger at its belt. The wickedly sharp dagger is of gleaming steel and shimmers when exposed to the light.
4. The wight wears a grimy silver necklace festooned with charms. The charms—also silver but covered in dirt and dried gore—depict several good-aligned deitys' symbols. The whole is worth 50 gp.
5. A steel potion vial fills a secret compartment in the heel of one of the wight's knee-length hard leather boots. The vial is broad and flat to fit into the heel but is sadly empty. Only perceptive characters find the vial.
6. A packet of mouldy trail rations fills the wight's pouch. The food is inedible but is packed in a cloth wrapping decorated with a simple map of the surrounding wilderness. The cloth must be cleaned to reveal the map's secrets—which could feature a hitherto unknown adventure site.
7. The wight has a longsword scabbard on its belt. The sword is long lost, but the sheath is a thing of beauty: black leather picked out with silvered thread. An intricate design of a fishing net decorates the scabbard's tip. It is worth 15 gp.
8. The wight carries a mouldy pouch full of coins (17 cp, 45 sp and 3 gp). When slain, the wight falls, which bursts open the pouch. Coins spill all over the floor.
9. This wight has a pair of battered, gold-rimmed spectacles shoved into a pocket in its cloak. The lens are missing, but the spectacles are worth 4 gp as scrap.
10. A broken arrow protrudes from the wight's left calf. The missile's tip is of a preternaturally tough, dark grey metal —the fabulously rare and valuable adamantine. 





# 1,000 ABNORMAL ZOMBIES

## PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION 

1. One side of the creature's face is nothing more than a suppurating, bloody mess; one of its eyes is missing.
2. The zombie's left arm is unnaturally bent at the elbow. As the zombie moves, shards of bone break through its rotting flesh.
3. Clad in blood-soaked peasant clothes, this person clearly suffered horrendous wounds before death.
4. A huge chunk of this zombie's stomach is missing; a few strands of entrails droop from the gaping wound, creating a skirt of sorts hanging down toward the zombie's knees.
5. This zombie's head lolls from side to side in a disturbing, unnatural fashion; its neck is clearly broken.
6. This zombie has no legs below the knee. Consequently, it crawls about, leaving a bloody slime trail in its wake.
7. This zombie's neck is partially severed; muscles and bone are visible through the gore.
8. This corpulent zombie is naked and filled with noxious gases. If struck with a sharp melee weapon, it explodes coating adjacent creatures with blood, bone and viscera.
9. This zombie has no jaw. Blood and gore cover its chest.
10. A gaping wound pierces this creature's rib cage, exposing the desiccated organs. 

## BATTLE TACTICS 



1. This zombie is much slower than its companions due to a broken leg. It moves at half speed.
2. As it advances, this zombie stumbles and falls. In the next round, it struggles back to its feet.
3. This zombie carries a melee weapon. Every round, it has a 50% chance of accidentally using the weapon.
4. This zombie has a shield strapped to its arm. Thus, its armour class is slightly better than its brethren.
5. This zombie fixes its dead, baleful gaze on one target and focuses on that individual above all others.
6. Freshly dead, this zombie leaves a wide trail of slippery blood and viscera behind it.
7. This zombie tries to grapple opponents instead of beating them to death. If successful, it begins biting.
8. This zombie is fast and easily outpaces its fellows.
9. This zombie has a smashed voice box. It yips and cackles in a similar way to a hunting jackal as it approaches.
10. This zombie moans and groans as it approaches its prey. 

## TREASURE 

1. This zombie wears a wide bloodstained leather belt which seems worthless at first glance. If the belt is cleaned, however, a complex pattern of stitches emerges, depicting what seems to be a section of dungeon complete with a secret room!
2. A golden hoop earring hangs from one of the zombie's decomposing ears. The plain band is worth 2 gp.
3. This zombie wears fine, knee-high leather boots that create an audible clacking sound on stone flooring. If cleaned, the boots are worth 3 gp, but moving quietly in them is hard.
4. A woven leather necklace hangs around the zombie's neck. Perceptive characters spot four thin golden threads hidden within. Each thread is worth 5 gp.
5. This zombie has a finger wedged in its mouth which wears a thin golden ring decorated with beautifully etched leaves and vines (worth 25 gp); foul-smelling saliva covers the band.
6. A slender silver chain encircles one of the zombie's ankles. Four small charms—representing the four elements—hang from the anklet. It is worth 10 gp.
7. A gore-coated dagger juts from the zombie's chest. The wickedly sharp silver dagger is wedged between two rib bones. It is worth 90 gp.
8. This zombie wears the slashed and stained remnants of a silk doublet. It is essentially worthless, but a skilled seamstress could harvest enough silk for several hankies and the like.
9. Slipped within its knee-high leather boots, this zombie carries a small, sharp dagger. Its pommel has a clenched fist design.
10. This zombie wears a cloak sporting a deep cowl. Perceptive characters find two platinum coins sewn into the hem. 





# ALCHEMIST' S LABORATORY 



## ALCHEMISTS AND THEIR ASSISTANTS 



1. ERFANNA NACKLE Happy, slightly-obsessed gnome with a dark secret. Wearing grubby clothes and a stained apron this one-eyed, rotund gnomish woman has a smile plastered across her broad, welcoming face. Erfanna Nackle (NG female gnome) finds fascination in the alchemist's art. She is obsessed with experimentation and can't wait to have a laboratory of her own. Personality: Friendly and cheerful, Erfanna seems in many ways to be a typical gnome. Sorrow for her twin brother, Janel, however, gnaws at her heart. He died in a tragic accident a decade ago, and she yet grieves for him. Mannerisms: Sometimes, when she thinks no one is looking at her, Erfanna's smile falters, and a faraway look fills her eyes. Hook: Erfanna was blamed for her brother's death and left her home in shame. Since then, she has been essentially alone in the world. She craves a deep connection with other people, and if the characters are nice to her she offers them her services. If they set her up in her own laboratory, she promises to craft them all manner of hitherto unknown wondrous elixirs, potions and salves.
2. GILLON DUERRAL Borderline alcoholic, fiercely loyal to his employer. A fine handaxe hangs from the broad belt worn by this blackhaired, dishevelled dwarven man. Gillon Duerral (LN male dwarf fighter 3) prizes loyalty above all things and is staunchly loyal to his employer. Gillon has many skills—cook, distiller of alcohol and carpenter. He is a skilled warrior. Personality: Gillon is quiet, thoughtful and introspective. He also loves brandy, whisky and all other hard spirits. Gillon is a dreamer and has big plans (see “Hooks” below). Mannerisms: Gillon is never without his silver hip flask (which is normally tucked into his belt). He has developed an incredible tolerance to alcohol and often takes a quick sip when he thinks no one is looking. He speaks quietly—for a sozzled dwarf. Hook: Gillon hopes to invent a process to make his beloved liquor even more potent. He believes there is a market for super-strong alcohol and dreams of discovering the process himself so he can set himself up in business.
3. JUSSO ANO Enthusiastic but in (desperate) need of training and restraint. Short brown hair frames this man's face, which is set into a mischievous grin. The man wears ragged, stained clothes, and the faint air of destitution hangs about his person. Juuso Ano (NG middle-aged male human) embodies extreme enthusiasm for alchemy, invention and the exploration of his field. He works feverishly with the alchemist for experience (and the coin necessary to keep his own small laboratory going). Personality: Juuso has a reputation for being a bit wild and relaxed about safety. He and his employer are constantly at odds—particularly over the alchemist's “ridiculous” focus on health and safety in the laboratory. Juuso is a devout follower of Abarin (N greater god of industry and artifice), and if he had an iota of patience could have made an excellent priest. Mannerisms: Juuso babbles—the words pouring forth like a torrent; only the sharp-eared understand him. Hook: While friendly, Juuso is poor—the cost of ingredients and the “occasional” repairs to his workshop stymie his attempts to get rich. He would be delighted to secure a wealthy patron—someone who could fund his research and help him out now and then with contributions toward his laboratory's repairs.
4. SIPRI MIEMO Works for an assassin guild. Tall and spry, this man moves with deft grace. Scars and tiny burn marks cover his hands and forearms. Sipri Miemo (NE male human assassin 6) masquerades as an alchemist's assistant but is actually a member of an assassin's guild. He has insinuated himself with the alchemist to learn their many secrets. Personality: Seemingly a pleasant man, Sipri does all he can to ingratiate himself with his employer and his employer's customers. Sipri is opportunistic and always looking for a better angle. He carefully pumps the characters for information about their needs and adventures, under the guise of his protecting his employer's interests. Blackhearted, and utterly without morals, Sipri could be both a terrible enemy or a dependable ally—if the price it right. Mannerisms: Sipri eyes are constantly in motion; perceptive characters feel Sipri is evaluating or measuring them up. Hook: The alchemist Sipri works for is rumoured to have discovered—or to be about to discover—a new form of explosive paste. The applications of such a discovery are legion—particularly for assassins intent on killing their targets while avoiding the dangers of actually striking them down. If Sipri feels the characters will distract or delay the alchemist from manufacturing this explosive paste he tries to get rid of them. (He doesn't resort to violence; instead, he tries to talk them out of engaging his employer).
5. VILPPU OTRA Maniacally obsessed with death and life. With long black hair tied back in a ponytail and taut, angular features this man has a haughty, aloof aura. Vilppu Otra (N middle-aged male human) believes alchemy— not magic—holds the secret to conquering death. Obsessed with this notion, he works feverishly in his laboratory. His research has led him to some dark places, and he has come to the attention of a powerful necromancer who has secretly started to guide and aid Vilppu's work. Personality: Manically obsessed with his work, Vilppu cares for little else. He sleeps only when he must and prefers to work at night. When he needs money, he reluctantly seeks out additional work in the surrounds; sometimes working as an apothecary, herbalist and doctor for those too poor to afford magic healing. Mannerisms: Vilppu's speech is short and curt unless he is discussing his research—something he only does with interested, learned individuals. Hooks: Vilppu requires fresh corpses for his work; he has reached the point where he must try his elixir of life on the dead. Rumours of grave-robbing reach the character's ears, and if they investigate the trail might lead back to Vilppu.
6. VILUTAR LEMPO Fugitive hiding from her powerful patron. Old and stooped, this white-haired woman has white hair and a careworn expression on her face. Vilutar Lempo (NG old female human wizard 4) fiercely protects her anonymity. In another life, she was Tilda Miela and worked for the lord of a far-off land. When she discovered the depths of his depravity, she fled, taking much of his gold and all her research. Now, she lives in fear of being uncovered by the lord's agents. Personality: Quiet and guarded, Vilutar finds it hard to make friends and is lonely. She is also tired—tired of running and tired of hiding—and just craves peace. She still loves her work, but it is becoming increasingly hard to muster the energy to continue. Mannerisms: Through long practice and habit, Vilutar always has an eye on the door. For one of such an advanced age, she has a surprising amount of nervous energy. Hooks: Vilutar is nervous; strange folk have been seen hanging around the streets near her workshop and asking questions of her neighbours. She fears she has been discovered by her previous master's agents and does not know what to do. If she encounters the characters—perhaps if they ask her to craft something—she asks them to investigate the matter instead of payment (once she has satisfied herself the characters are not the agents she fears so much). 





## THINGS TO SEE IN A LABORATORY 



1. Large glass vats contain thick yellow liquid pregnant with large golden bubbles. The raising bubbles pop so noisily conversation is difficult near them.
2. Heating plates made from thick metal slabs fixed onto a stone kiln heat some strange-smelling substances in copper bowls and pans.
3. Racks on the walls and tables hold hundreds of glass and clay test tubes filled with a plethora of multicoloured powders. The vials, all made of thick glass, are weighted to prevent tipping yet one has fallen and released a golden powder onto the alchemist's desk.
4. Crystal bowls with copper framing heat over crackling fires. Thick white gasses swirling over sandy chemicals, struggle up glass tubes to be collected in sealed glass jars. The air has a pungent smell to it.
5. A mortar and pestle of thick black-streaked granite hold the powdered residue of incinerated plants. The powdery white ash has clumped together from the moisture of a nearby water flask.
6. A many-tiered athanor (a furnace) made of heavy clay bricks has hundreds of conical flasks on its shelves. The metal door at its base has been left slightly open by an inattentive apprentice, and the glowing ashes are starting to spill out.
7. Polished crystal stirring rods change colour depending on the temperature of the solution they are stirring. Of varying lengths and thicknesses they are used in different substances and sometimes cause explosions if used incorrectly.
8. Jars of odd ingredients are hidden at the back of high shelves. Amongst them lie the skin from a ghoul's hand and the brain of a serial murderer stored in glass jars filled with vinegar. Many of the ingredients are illegal, and should the authorities find them, the alchemist will be in serious trouble.
9. On a stone shelf overlooking the alchemist's desk sits a jar holding a pickled monkey head. The head is a failed experiment to create a homunculus, and still holds a semblance of life. Perceptive characters notice the eyes twitch occasionally, and its tiny malformed hands grasp at things beyond its glassy prison.
10. A troll's hand rests in a jar of weak acid to suppress its regeneration abilities. The hand's green, warty skin is now pitch black and covered with smooth scales, giving it a slightly demonic appearance.
11. Two copper rods that flash every now and then with a bright electrical spark are attached to a confused jumble of tubes and wires. The electrical charge is generated by a chemical reaction between the stomach acid of a giant fly and the powdered clay found in the nearby marshes.
12. Hanging herbs and dried parts of strange animals dangle from the roof beams. Amidst the monkey arms and chicken legs, the calcified arm of a pigmy witch doctor still contains part of his spirit and it silently waits to wreak its revenge on the alchemist and anyone unfortunate enough to be nearby.
13. A pot of green liquid sits on a heating plate at the back of a desk, bubbling gently. A distracted alchemist may leave it heating too long, allowing it to boil over and fill the area with choking soporific gas.
14. A thick liquid, whose bubbles pop like farts, gently simmers in a metal cauldron hanging over a fire. Despite looking like a typical witches' dinner, the liquid is used to make a thick white glaze that heat-proofs the outside of clay ovens and jars.
15. Retorts made from nut-like plants not affected by sputtering flames boil away gases before being sealed with a tarry black paste. The chemicals stored within violently explode when exposed to air, typically when they are thrown at the alchemist's enemies.
16. A sand bath used unsuccessfully to vaporise dragon's acid takes up most of the top shelf of a stone kiln. Hidden behind it lies a forgotten tube of chemicals.
17. A glass jar containing the white powdery residue from a random experiment lies precariously on the edge of the alchemist's desk.
18. Pans of dried plants ready to be incinerated to make soda ash for glass rest above kilns near vents where the heat can dry them out. Several vats of the precious ash stand nearby, ready for the local glassblower to collect.
19. The contents of a steel bowl rattle and pop furiously over an intense white flame. The liquid—a thin red blood-like substance splatters over the nearby workbench.
20. Glass globes with sporadically bubbling liquid, which changes colours every few minutes throwing eerie light around the laboratory, offsets the usual dreary glow of the various other light sources in the laboratory. 





## ALCHEMICAL MISHAPS 



1. Working under the intimidating glare of his alchemist master, a mining apprentice strikes a vein of explosive material in a large rock causing an explosion.
2. Leaking chemicals have weakened the insides of an athanor. When several experiments are bubbling away on its shelves the whole thing collapses, sending chemicals and acids everywhere. The resulting mess is a bubbling gloop that oozes outwards and traps everything—expensive glass retorts and apprentices alike —in its quick-drying embrace.
3. An unexpected explosion fills the laboratory with smoke sending the alchemist and his servants crashing through the equipment to escape. A dangerous sentient ooze is freed by their frenzied escape and begins to feed—at first on rats and spiders—but eventually, its trembling senses seek larger prey.
4. Invisible gas seeps from the edges of a cracked retort, filling the air with heady fumes that send people into peals of laughter and hysterical giggles.
5. The alchemist excitedly takes delivery of a dangerous creature frozen in specially made alchemical ice. Unfortunately, the creature has started to awaken and takes offence at being trapped in its icy prison.
6. Thieves attack a wagon containing explosive materials as it approaches the alchemist's laboratory. During the melee, the thieves accidentally ignite the explosive materials killing themselves and the drovers. The explosion causes a nearby building to collapse. Townsfolk are trapped in the ruins.
7. Stone shelves weighed down with too many jars collapse and dump their contents on the floor. The resulting mixtures create dense, choking green gas. As the gas billows through the room, acid eats its way through the floor.
8. As the characters arrive at the laboratory, an experiment goes horribly wrong. A muted explosion followed by an outpouring of smoke from the building's windows are the obvious signs of disaster. The smoke contains powerful hallucinogens, and when the wind picks up, it blows over the surrounding neighbourhood. The alchemist begs the characters for help.
9. An unruly apprentice has been disposing of chemicals in the nearby sewers. Strange slugs dwelling in the sewers have feasted upon the chemicals, and have developed a taste for flesh after slaying the apprentice. Hungry, they begin to hunt.
10. The alchemist has been experimenting with the corpse of a murderer. Consequently, the laboratory is the home of a malicious, haunting presence that causes experiments to go wrong with disastrous results.
11. Servants are confused to find the alchemist missing after they arrive in the morning for work. All that remains of the alchemist are his boots.
12. Despite taking great care, an alchemist's experiment releases a lethal invisible gas that kills everyone in the laboratory. The local authorities seal off the building, but a group of thieves try to sneak into the laboratory to steal the recipe.
13. The alchemist discovers how to turn lead into gold. Unknown to all, the transformation is temporary and wears off within a month, leaving nothing but calcified metal behind.
14. Local glassmakers have provided the alchemist with shoddy work. Consequently, the alchemist drips acid onto his legs, maiming them so badly they have to be amputated. He is incensed and craves revenge.
15. Whilst making a rushed batch of ointment to cure a rampant disease savaging the locals, the alchemist accidentally creates a slow-acting poison that kills the patients instead.
16. Joining forces with a distiller, an enterprising alchemist tries to create bubbling gin (with disastrous results).
17. Whilst extracting poison from the skin of toads and frogs, the alchemist accidentally loses a frog. The ensuing deaths are a mystery to all except the alchemist. Terrified he will be found out and hanged, the alchemist prepares to flee.
18. The alchemist is working under duress for an assassin who has captured his family. The alchemist plots a deadly accident for his captor, but it goes disastrously wrong, and innocent bystanders are killed while the assassin miraculously survives.
19. Rats eating the refuse from the alchemist's laboratory become charged with manic energy. They breed repeatedly and quickly and succumb to a frenzy of eating. Nearby stores and granaries are ravaged, and the local authorities ask the characters to track down and kill the rats.
20. Whilst breaking down an exotic rock, the alchemist releases an angry earth elemental trapped within the stone. As it breaks free, the elemental knocks over and absorbs many of the alchemist's chemicals. This exposure gives the elemental strange powers, making it much harder to defeat. 





## COMPLICATIONS & OPPORTUNITIES 



1. A shipment of meticulously prepared silica must be taken to a glassmaker, but another alchemist has got word of the shipment and wants it for their own. The alchemist asks the characters to protect the shipment.
2. An alchemist experimenting with the restorative powers associated with necromancy needs the contents of a recently hung criminal's stomach. Unfortunately, the criminal yet hangs from the city gates as a warning to other criminals.
3. A vial of powdered red dragon scale has been stolen by an apprentice working for a rival. It was to be used in making fireproof clay for ovens in a local orphanage. Powerful people in the area sponsor the orphanage, and the alchemist is desperate to retrieve the powered dragon scale before the theft is discovered.
4. Pretending to be an alchemist, a necromancer needs bits of dead bodies or undead creatures for his work. He asks the characters to retrieve the contents of several graves and pays a bonus for interesting bits of “monsters” should the party find any. Unfortunately, a local church has found out about the necromancer, and their spies report back to paladins and clerics who are enraged at this activity.
5. A local wizard needs distilled gorgon's blood for use in the creation of the mortar for his tower. Unfortunately, the wizard is a sworn enemy of the only local alchemist skilled enough to distil the blood properly. In addition to hunting down the beast, the characters must talk the alchemist into taking the job—which may necessitate doing the alchemist a favour.
6. Seeing an opportunity, a corrupt guard seizes a batch of precious chemicals destined for the alchemist's laboratory and tries to sell them on the black market. The alchemist hires the party to retrieve the chemicals.
7. Miners have discovered a rich vein of rare chemicals in a new dig. The alchemist hires the party to protect the mine from bandits. When the characters reach the mine, they discover many of the miners are stealing the ore and a corrupt foreman refusing to pay his workers.
8. After selling rare ore discovered in a creature's hoard to an alchemist, the party run into trouble when the alchemist accuses them of cheating him on the quality. The alchemist sends thieves after the party to get his money back.
9. Rumours spread of a rare creature spotted in the locality, and an alchemist hires the party to kill the beast. Unknown to the characters, other parties are after the creature and react badly to rival hunters.
10. A local mine rich in a soft, malleable stone perfect for creating alchemical equipment has been dug too deep and is now under attack from unseen horrors from below. The horrors are hallucinations caused by a strange gas present in the mine, and the party— investigating on behalf of a local alchemist—find themselves the target of enraged miners before encountering the strange gas themselves.
11. An alchemist's rival offers to sell cheap goods to the party. Unfortunately, many of the items are flawed; some fail completely while others have much-reduced efficacy or even randomly activate.
12. Birds plague an alchemist by breaking his windows to get at the shiny things in the laboratory. A local wizard is sending the birds to disrupt the alchemist's work so he might steal the alchemist's workbook.
13. When an experiment goes wrong hallucinogenic gasses are released into the local sewers causing disruption and chaos in the nearby streets. Exploration of the sewers leads to a hidden laboratory and an unaware alchemist irate at being disturbed by adventurers.
14. Oozes and slimes form part of a clumsy alchemist's research, but he recently careless let one escape—and one of his servants disappeared as a result. The servant's family ask the party to investigate the disappearance.
15. Young nobles are extorting an alchemist for hangover cures and love potions. After they refuse to pay for the second time, the alchemist asks the party for help.
16. A druid petitions the party for help as an alchemist is destroying the natural habitat while searching for ingredients for his experiments. The alchemist is unaware of the damage he is causing and beseeches the party to act as mediators so he can rectify his mistakes and secure the ingredients he desperately needs.
17. Children target a cantankerous old alchemist by throwing stones through his windows and causing a minor explosion and fire. Chemicals and experiments catch fire with colourful and dangerous results.
18. A noble pays an alchemist for fireworks for a party, but the alchemist takes the money and leaves town. The noble hires the party to track the alchemist down. When they reach him, they find he is using the money to support several families ruined by the noble's greed.
19. A rare (and dangerous) creature is plaguing the area after hunters killed its young and harvested the body for rare ingredients. A trail of clues leads back to an unscrupulous alchemist and his jaded mercenaries.
20. An ageing alchemist needs help making a homunculus but has somehow managed to follow the instructions incorrectly with potentially disastrous results. Now the semi-sentient homunculus cavorts about the alchemist's laboratory, making the alchemist's life a misery. 





# ANCIENT NECROPOLIS 







## THINGS TO FIND IN A NECROPOLIS 



1. Strange markings in the dust suggest something was pushed or dragged through this area. What it might have been, however, is unknown.
2. Part of the doorway ahead has collapsed, dumping rubble onto the floor. The door itself lies splintered and broken under the rubble.
3. This mural depicts an idealised external view of the necropolis being approached by a long column of people. It has been defaced by several heavy blows from a blunt object.
4. A burnt-out torch stub lies discarded on the floor. A smudge of charcoal on the stone flooring shows where it guttered out.
5. Thick, dusty cobwebs cloak the ceiling. Dark shapes— cocooned insects and dead spiders—hang amid the webs. The spiders may be simply dead, or the necrotic energies of the nearby buried dead could have transformed them into a swarm of tiny zombie spiders hungry for warm flesh!
6. Strange carvings of hideous demonic heads leer down over this area from several stone half-height pillars standing against one wall. The pillars and heads are painted in various lurid colours to appear more terrifying. The paint is dulled with age and peeling.
7. Runes depicting death, damnation and doom decorate an archway leading away from this area.
8. Clad in wisps of burial shroud, the skeleton of some poor unfortunate soul sprawls across the floor.
9. Several bricks have fallen—or been pried away—from the wall to reveal a small dusty cavity; within lies a rusting lever, but it is not obvious what it operates. From its condition, it doesn't look like it has been used in years.
10. A rusty portcullis fills an archway, blocking access to what lies beyond. The portcullis itself has been forged to look like a web of intertwined vipers. Cobwebs hang from the portcullis, and dust lies thickly upon the intricately forged serpents, blurring their finer details.
11. A lurid collection of yellow skulls glowers down at intruders from a high niche cut into the wall. Investigation of the shelf reveals a deep and narrow space cut into the wall behind and below the niche; it is filled with bones.
12. A mosaic of black, purple and red tiles covers the floor. The mosaic's pattern seems entirely random, but a viewer looking down on it from a decent height can see it comprises the death god's sigil intertwined with symbols of protection and vengeance.
13. Faded murals depicted the souls of the departed being judged in the death god's halls decorate the walls.
14. The inscription over this doorway speaks of the dire curses and agonising deaths waiting for any who would disturb the dead resting beyond. However, part of the inscription has crumbled away (or perhaps it was defaced by previous explorers); thus, its full meaning may not be clear. This could also mean that any magic lurking in the inscription—perhaps some dire trap—has long since faded.
15. An ancient rust-coloured stain mars the floor. The stain is —of course—long dried blood, and it looks like from its size, whatever bled here probably died.
16. A thick grey gloop slowly oozes through cracks in the ceiling and splatters onto the floor. This slow, constant accumulation of gunk has created a semi-solid slurry pile of odourless slime covering most of the floor.
17. A gust of wind blows the dust of ages past into the party's faces and creates swirling dust devils that dance around the chamber for a few moments.
18. A faint breeze caresses the party's faces. The breeze creates swirling eddies of dust around the party's ankles, seeming to grasp at their warm, life-filled flesh.
19. The floor ahead is cracked and pitted. Several flagstones have shifted upwards, creating an area of uneven flooring. The area smells of dampness and mould.
20. The wind sighs through the necropolis. To the paranoid, nervous or confused, it almost sounds like the building itself is breathing... 

## BURIAL NICHE DRESSING 

1. Dusty shreds of clothing cling to the bones filling this deep niche.
2. This skeleton clutches the desiccated stalks of a bunch of flowers.
3. A faded sheet, decorated embroidered with mystic symbols, covers this child-sized skeleton.
4. The tiny skeletons of a half-dozen rats lie scattered about this niche. There is no sign of its original inhabitant.
5. The head of this skeleton rests on a dusty pillow filled with bone dry, flammable straw.
6. A rusty iron grill (which swings upwards if the lock is removed) protects this niche.
7. This skeleton's skull is missing.
8. This skeleton is twisted and bent as if the person was warped by horrible magic.
9. A single rune—meaning “Cursed”—is inscribed in the stone above this niche.
10. This niche is empty, except for a torn burial shift. 











## THINGS TO FIND IN A DUSTY CRYPT 



1. Water oozes down the walls from above, leaving tracks on the ancient brickwork. On the ground, the water has turned the dust into a thick paste-like grey ooze.
2. Dusty cobwebs fill the corners of the ceiling.
3. A small portion of brickwork from one wall has fallen away, revealing the bare rock behind. A low pile of rubble lies on the floor nearby.
4. Dust sifts down from the archway over a door. The stones of the arch have shifted; consequently, the door is harder than normal to force open. If the door is opened, the stones above groan ominously, and dust sifts down into the doorway...
5. Incongruously, a single bone—a thighbone—lies on the floor in front of a shadowy archway.
6. The walls here were once decorated with brightly painted images painted directly onto the smooth stone. The colours have long since faded, and now only a suggestion of what once was remains.
7. A section of the floor is bumpy and uneven, making rapid movement difficult. The paving slabs can be easily pried up, but nothing of interest lies beneath.
8. A pillar once held up the roof here, but it collapsed at some point in the distant past. Dust shrouds the resultant pile of rubble; the ceiling over the debris sags noticeably and dangerously.
9. Several niches that once contained offerings to those buried here pierce the walls. All have succumbed to time's remorseless advance and are now nothing more than small piles of rotting, rusting or desiccated remains.
10. Huge religious symbols appropriate to the faith that built the crypt have been carved into the walls. Dust and cobwebs shroud portions of the carvings. Tracing the grandest of the carvings with one's hand deactivates a nearby trap.
11. Statues of the faithful garbed for war stand guard over this area. Half have serene looks on their faces while the others' faces are twisted with hate. The statues are arrayed so they all look towards the entrance.
12. Niches cut into the wall hold the shrouded skeletons of a long-dead worshipper. Dust, cobwebs and other detritus cover the remains. The densely packed niches run from floor to ceiling. An ornate shroud edged with silver and gold thread covers the corpse in one of the particularly inaccessible niches near the ceiling.
13. Several small holes pierce the wall at ground level. Small dried faeces—typical of that left by rats, mice or other rodents—cover the floor.
14. Small holes in the ceiling emit a faint cold breeze into the chamber. The constant draught stirs the dust covering the floor. Paranoid explorers may think some form of invisible guardian lurks within the dust cloud.
15. Carved holy symbols decorate the walls of this area. Several have been deliberately defaced, but there seems to be no obvious reason for this deliberate vandalism.
16. A faded mosaic covers the floor. It depicts a stylised representation of the afterlife, but exact details are hard to pick out as some of the tiles are cracked, and others are missing.
17. Several burial niches in this area are empty. In all cases, discarded burial shrouds lie in the niche or nearby. Have the remains been removed, or are they lurking animate guardians of the complex?
18. A narrow ventilation shaft cut into the ceiling allows a thin ray of pale light into the crypt.
19. Burial niches pierce this area's walls (see #12 above). The remains of one of the interred has fallen from its niche and lie draped across the floor nearby.
20. Cockroaches and other insects once infested this crypt. Feasting on the remains of those interred here, they grew fat and numerous, but when they ran out of food, they died off. Now their desiccated remains coat the floor and make creeping about difficult as they loudly crunch underfoot). 





## THINGS TO FIND IN A SARCOPHAGUS 



1. The occupant's head rests on a dusty and faded red pillow. Cursory examination made while searching the pillow reveals a small cache of old gold coins minted in a kingdom long since crumbled to dust. The fifteen heavy and oversized coins are worth 100 gp to a sage, collector or student of history. They depict the fallen kingdom's heraldry on one side and the profile of a ruler on the reverse.
2. Although it only contains the remains of one body, this sarcophagus holds two skulls. One clearly suffered a violent death.
3. A fine white sheet edged in silver trim covers the occupant's remains. The trim is worth 15 gp.
4. The sarcophagus is filled with bones from many individuals, all jumbled together. The sarcophagus has a hidden niche in the bottom, only accessible when the bulk of the bones have been removed. The secret niche holds the remains of an important individual still wearing two ornate golden bracers decorated with engravings of swooping birds of prey (worth 400 gp).
5. The sarcophagus's occupant clutches a mouldering scroll in his hands. It crumbles if touched, but an investigation of the remains reveals several indistinct religious symbols.
6. The inside of the sarcophagus's lid has scratch marks—as if the interred had tried to escape.
7. The stench of decay greets explorers opening this sarcophagus; mould and strange fungi have taken root on the decomposing body within. Characters opening the sarcophagus, must have a strong stomach or retch due to the smell for 2d6 minutes.
8. The sarcophagus contains not only the skeleton of his intended occupant but also the remains of four huge rats. A close inspection of the occupant's skeletons reveals hundreds of teeth marks.
9. The skeleton (strangely) is lying on its front. Among its rotting clothes, perceptive adventurers spot a thin leather cord around its neck. A silver heart-shaped pendant (worth 30 gp) hangs from the cord.
10. Curled at the feet of the sarcophagus' inhabitant lie the remains of a small dog, cat or other small pet.
11. The inside face of the sarcophagus's lid has an illustrated prayer carved into it. The prayer speaks of peace in death, and the illustrations depict angels carrying the deceased's soul up to the clouds.
12. The occupant has been decapitated and staked through the heart.
13. The sarcophagus has two occupants; they have been laid to rest holding hands.
14. The sarcophagus holds a child's remains. Several small worn and faded toys lie amid the dust.
15. The sarcophagus's bottom has many small holes bored through it. A slight breeze blows through these holes, and when the sarcophagus's lid is removed, a great cloud of grave dust billows up around the characters. The dust is harmless, but the characters won't know that.
16. Carvings from the deceased's life decorate the inside of the sarcophagus. A perceptive character notices several tiny imps among the carvings depicted in the midst of some form of mischief or trickery.
17. Only a skull resting on a faded black cushion lies in the sarcophagus. Even casual observers note that all the skull's teeth and jaw have been smashed.
18. This sarcophagus has never held a body—instead, someone used it as a secret storage place. It contains 236 gp, 478 sp and a pair of gleaming silver daggers. The daggers have a raven engraved on their pommels.
19. The lid of this sarcophagus sits slightly askew, and amid the bones and mouldering clothes within lair half a dozen feral rats.
20. Lead lines the inside of this sarcophagus. The skeleton within wears faded fine robes in a style not common or popular for decades. She also wears a large golden ring set with a sharp shard of obsidian on one finger. The ring is valuable (200 gp) for its materials alone. The ring could be merely valuable or the component of a special magical prison... 

## SARCOPHAGUS LID DECORATIONS 



1. A smiling image of the deceased's face.
2. Interlinked geometric shapes.
3. A stylised woodland scene replete with numerous birds and animals.
4. The person's name, age and cause of death.
5. A prayer to the deceased's patron deity.
6. A personalised poem telling of the deceased's life, focusing on particularly noteworthy events.
7. A blazing sun or a constellation of stars.
8. The holy (or unholy) symbol of the deceased's deity 





## THINGS TO FIND ON A THIEF' S BODY 



1. A yet supple, tightly coiled silk rope fills the bottom of this thief's pack. A lightweight iron grapple hook forged to look like a grasping hand is attached to one end.
2. Clutched in one hand, this corpse holds a partial map of the necropolis. The faded markings show the robber's route from its main entrance to where he fell.
3. The robber's belt pouch holds several golden trinkets looted from nearby tombs. Wrapped in dirty linen, the pouch holds three tarnished small silver rings and a worn bracelet worth 70 gp.
4. Much of these thieves' tools are rusted or broken. However, one pouch holds a small, hand-held magnifying glass and two small brushes suitable for carefully brushing away dust, grit and so on.
5. A burnt-out torch lies near this robber's body. A search of his pack reveals no other light sources.
6. This robber carried a hammer and several chisels of various sizes wrapped in strips of supple, worn leather.
7. Clad all in black, this robber also wore thigh-high leather boots that are in excellent repair.
8. This robber wore two whistles around his neck on a long leather thong. The first is shaped like a dog's head and emits a sound too high pitched for humans to hear. The second is shaped like a feather and produces the lovely sound of birdsong when blown.
9. Bulging pouches hang from this robber's belt. Sadly, they do not contain loot; instead, the dead thief filled them with every conceivable tool he might need. The kit weighs twice as much as normal but provides a small bonus to attempts to pick locks or disarm traps.
10. This robber was carrying a bulging sack when he met his fate. From the fallen sack lying close to one outstretched hand have tumbled several skulls, some still festooned with wisps of hair. What the robber wanted with such grizzly treasure is unknown. 





## PROTECTIVE CURSES 



1. Rows of bleached skulls form the lintel of a stone doorway. Anyone passing underneath alerts any undead within 60 ft. to its presence for 1d4 days.
2. Ancient, but valuable, silver coins (worth 30 gp) cover the eyes of a mummified humanoid. Taking the coins inflicts blindness on the thieving character for 1d4 hours.
3. The funeral shroud of a mummy lies inscribed with deeds describing its former life. Anyone reading the script acts out the mummy's life at night while sleepwalking for one week.
4. A jewelled vase (worth 150 gp) lies at the foot of a sarcophagus inscribed with the visage of a beautiful woman. Disturbing the vase transforms any nonmagical liquids within the room into bitter tears. This change is not immediately noticeable and only comes to light when the liquid is drunk or used.
5. A golden necklace (worth 200 gp) found amongst a pile of brittle bones causes whoever takes it to sob inconsolably for five minutes after committing violence against another living creature.
6. An inscription on the floor, if not intoned properly and placated with an offering of blood, causes anyone passing over it to feel a tangible sadness, effectively doubling their weight for 24 hours.
7. A skeleton grips a bejewelled dagger (worth 145 gp). Whoever removes the blade begins suffering mysterious cuts, taking 1d4 damage every six hours until the weapon is discarded.
8. A small pearl (worth 100 gp) rests in the mouth of a skull. Removing the pearl causes the person to speak only in an ancient language for 1d6 days. This does not affect spell casting.
9. A silver skull (worth 250 gp) nestles within the lid of a sarcophagus. Anyone touching the skull has vivid and horrific nightmares that night and is unable to gain the benefits of a food night's rest.
10. A golden ring (worth 50 gp) worn on a mummy's hand causes the hand of anyone touching it to be paralysed for 2d4 hours.
11. Bas-reliefs of underworld spirits guard a doorway. Crossing the threshold causes offenders to be attacked by a wraith the next time their hit points drop below half.
12. An ornate funerary urn (worth 65 gp) causes the skin of those who touch it to become brittle (all damage taken is doubled) for 1d4 hours.
13. A stack of 50 ancient gold coins creates feelings of intense greed and paranoia in anyone who takes it for 1d6 days.
14. A golden crown (worth 300 gp), perched on a skeleton's head, temporarily possesses whoever removes it with the deceased's spirit for 1d4 hours.
15. A bloodstained pit filled with bones (and three enticingly placed gems worth 50 gp each) causes whoever enters it to hear the screams of dying creatures for 3d4 hours.
16. An ornate golden goblet (worth 225 gp) lies entombed with a skeleton. Anyone taking the goblet tastes blood in their mouth and is unable to drink any liquids for 2d4 hours—doing so makes the drinker violently—even explosively—sick.
17. A small, cracked silver mirror (worth 35 gp) creates a hate-filled, murderous doppelgänger of whoever stares into it. The doppelgänger emerges 1d20 minutes after the characters leave the area or discard the mirror. It then begins to hunt the character down.
18. Any person passing by a row of upright sarcophagi has to reroll the next roll made to avoid or mitigate damage within the next 24 hours, as the spirits of the dead cluster around them.
19. A bone-strewn floor causes whoever disturbs the debris to move at half-speed for 1d4 hours as if dragged down by innumerable ghostly hands.
20. A golden bracelet (worth 75 gp) adorning a skeleton's arm fuses to the arm of whoever touches it for 1d3 days. While the bracket is attached, the arm has a will of its own and cannot be controlled. It doesn't try to harm the character but often does strange or inappropriate things. 


### STRANGE EFFECTS 

1. Faint mist clings to the floor.
2. Multi-coloured glimmering shards of light float gently in the air.
3. Thick shadows cloak the small nooks and crannies in this area. Only magical light banishes them.
4. Faint groaning emanates from the walls; perhaps it is the spirits of those buried within lamenting their fate, or perhaps the old stones are simply moving and shifting.
5. The air is cold; frost clings to the walls and floor.
6. Small motes of insubstantial darkness float like dust upon the air. They disappear when they collide with a warm-blooded creature.
7. The translucent, spectral image of what the necropolis looked like in its prime is superimposed over the place's current condition. This effect is sporadic and fades in and out of view.
8. Bones in some burial niches seem to shudder and move slightly when a character gets too close. 





## MINOR HAUNTINGS 



1. A ghostly procession of priests drags a screaming servant down a tunnel leading deeper into the necropolis's bowels.
2. The vacant eye sockets of a pillar of skulls glow red and scream in an ancient language when the party passes by.
3. A shimmering, translucent group wearing robes of ancient cut kneel before a sarcophagus. As one, they draw long daggers, thrusting them into their hearts before disappearing. Their brittle bones remain among the dust.
4. A noblewoman drags the corpse of a man, stabbed many times, behind her before dumping the body in a corner and sneering as she fades away. A dust-shrouded skeleton remains to bear witness to her crime.
5. Spectral people blink in and out of existence along a row of bone-filled niches piercing the wall.
6. Two armoured figures clash violently in front of the tattered remains of an ancient tapestry depicting them.
7. A translucent, roguish figure flashes a wide grin at the nearest character before disappearing through a wall (which reveals the location of a hidden secret door to observant characters).
8. Skulls fill numerous shelves bored into the wall. They begin to chatter and moan when any living creature comes within five-foot.
9. A regal figure rests within an open sarcophagus, appearing to be alive but asleep. Touching the body causes a spirit in the figure's likeness to rise, scream and then dissipate, leaving nothing but a mouldering corpse behind.
10. Shadowy figures hound the footsteps of anyone within the room, appearing just out of sight.
11. Bones skitter madly across the floor, rising briefly before clattering back down.
12. Lids swing open on several coffins before slamming shut. Muffled screams come from within the coffins.
13. Phantasmal figures feast at a ghostly table on fine food and wine before a shrieking wind sweeps them—and the table—away.
14. The sounds of laughter, sobbing and screaming swirl through the air around piles of stacked skulls. As quickly as the sounds begin, they end.
15. Pale figures fly from a series of urns, streaking towards any living creature, their mouths rent with fury, before disappearing with a cackle.
16. A family of five transparent figures watches intruders, their eyes vacant black holes of swirling energy.
17. The temperature drops abruptly to freezing, and any living creature feels hands trying to pull them down through the floor.
18. The temperature rises to sweltering levels as if the explorers have entered a fire. Blackened, writhing figures flicker just out of sight.
19. Blood appears to spurt out from niches along the wall, accompanied by a torrent of screams.
20. Everyone feels claustrophobic as if the room is no larger than a coffin. Sometimes, when explorers encounter haunts, they suffer ill effects. Sample effects include:
1. The sight of the haunt leaves the character shaken for a half-hour.
2. The intense emotions radiating from the haunt leave the character dazed for half an hour.
3. Sickened by the otherworldly suffering of the haunt, the character feels intensely sick until they next eat.
4. Wisps of the haunt cling to the character and suckle upon his warmth. This leaves the character sluggish and tired for an hour.
5. The sight of the haunt damages the character's sanity. They temporarily lose 1 point of Wisdom. It returns after a day of complete rest.
6. Contact with the otherworldly nature of the haunt inflicts 1d6 damage on the character. 

### STRANGE SOUNDS 



1. The skittering of tiny clawed feet on stone.
2. The gentle sigh of the wind (perhaps accompanied by tiny, swirling dust devils).
3. Rocks or stones clatter to the ground.
4. A guttural cackling slowly tails off into a gurgle.
5. A choir's faint chanting in an ancient tongue floats through the dead necropolis. (The chant is a litany for the dead).
6. Something large slithers through the necropolis. The party hear the rasp of its scales on stone.
7. Somewhere distant, a gong sounds once.
8. The clanking of chains—as if something like a gate was being raised or lowered—breaks the silence.
9. Soft, tinkling chimes sound from an unknown locale for a few minutes every half hour.
10. A faint susurrus of whispering—its tone oddly menacing— occasionally reaches the party's ears.
11. Unidentifiable instruments play a mournful dirge.
12. Sobbing—perhaps from ghostly mourners. 





# ARCHIVES & LIBRARIES 







## BOOKS IN THE COMMON COLLECTION 




### HISTORY BOOKS 

1. The Bloodstained Prince: This small leather tome is a recounting of the (doomed) attempt of Crown Prince Ilasual Nenonen to seize the throne of Ashlar from his sister, Aelliah Nenonen. The book ends with a chapter speculating on the Bloodstained Prince's unknown fate.
2. Five Ships: This book recounts the story of the legendary Lost Treasure Fleet of the Five Sisters. It tells how the five sisters—refer to both as freebooters and pirates—sailed to a far-off land and discovered a vast treasure. On their voyage home, the sisters fell to arguing before a savage storm blew up from the west. The tempest sunk all five ships, and only a few sailors survived the tragedy to return to their home ports with wild tales of islands rising from the deep and manytentacled beasts that slew their shipmates.
3. Doom Among the Gray Spires: Almost two centuries ago, an adventuring party—the Company of the Blue Shields—penetrated deep into the Forest of Gray Spires. This book is the story of their expedition. It tells of encounters with demon-worshipping elves, the discovery of stone statues depicting a race of one-eyed giants and other strange events and discoveries.
4. Vilimzair Aralivar—His Amazing Life: This oft-read book tells the incredible story of Vilimzair Aralivar. Vilimzair rose from humble origins to become both a fearsome pirate captain and the greatest bard the world has ever known (according to the book). Strangely, the book is graffitied as if the readers had grown angry at Vilimzair's incredible escapades. 

### RELIGIOUS BOOKS 

1. I Walked the Earth: This small dog-eared, singed book is an autobiography of Juhana Ehtaro, the so-called “Walking Priest”. Juhana was a devout half-elven follower of Behron reputed to have seen more lands and strange places than any other traveller. The book contains interesting descriptions of many far-off, hidden or mythical places of potential interest to adventurers.
2. The Book of Tides: The Book of Tides is the sacred text of the Storm Mistress. It not only teaches of the timeless beauty of the ocean but also records details of tides, storms and other nautical phenomena stretching back centuries. It records shipwrecks, the faithful's strange sighting at sea, details of the many monsters dwelling in the sea's depths and more. Every copy is slightly different as individual worshippers add to the store of information therein.
3. Cults and their Doings: This short pamphlet features sensationalised stories and a series of lurid pictures depicting foul cultists in the midst of their blasphemous rites. Much of the pamphlet's contents are clearly rubbish and are based on public misconceptions of various evil religions. However, one section detailing the Fellowship of the Onyx Trapezohedron is accurate and depicts be-robed worshippers slowly crushing their victims under a gigantic trapezohedron suspended from huge chains.
4. Scripture of Law: This vast tome contains teaching, stories and lessons by some of Darlen's (LG greater god of law, order, justice and the sun) early, prominent followers. It is the faith's most important book and the bedrock of the church. 

### GENERAL INTEREST BOOKS 

1. On the Road (An Accounting of the Many Journeys and Hardships of Hilppa Jutikka): Hilppa Jutikka was a merchant dogged by bad luck, happenstance and illfated events. To read his book is to marvel he survived long enough to write it. A careful reading of the book, however, reveals Hilppa was simply inept.
2. The Beauty of Numbers: This book deals with mathematics and its application in a wide range of situations. As well as providing practical instruction in numeration, the book includes a rambling appendix dealing with the study of probabilities, numerical patterns and the like that apparently shape the world and everything in it.
3. Beyond the Horizon: This small book contains the sea diary of Jegor Kalamies, and details his many journeys. He describes terrible storms, desperate battles against pirates and more. Jegor also included some rough sketch maps of various locales that might be of interest to adventurers planning a sea voyage.
4. The Deeds of Power: This slightly treasonous book relates—in breathless detail—the alleged deeds and doings of the Nenonen family. Much of the book may—or may not—be true, but some interesting nuggets, particularly of Arndul Nenonen's exploration of Gloamhold, appear within. Other scandals—hints of illegitimate children and a dark, unrecorded secret—also appear in the book. 





## BOOKS IN THE SPECIAL COLLECTION 



1. Encyclopaedia Geographia: This massive leatherbound book weighs almost 20 pounds. Each page is almost two-foot wide by three-foot-long. The book presents maps, discourses and studies of the terrain for hundreds of miles in every direction. Some of the maps are copies of ancient maps from now fallen elder or lost civilisations and peoples; these maps may depict features or locations omitted from more recent maps that could be of interest to adventurers.
2. On the Art: Originally written by Dorotea Laso, On the Art is a treatise on the fundamentals of wizardly magic. Written in the language of dragons, it has formed the basis of magical instruction since it was first copied and shared centuries ago. For a book on magic, it is a common tome, and its inclusion in the special collection is surprising. Investigation, however, reveals this book to be the original! A profession of marginalia reveals Dorotea's evolving thoughts and musing on the nature of magic.
3. The Morankan Manuscript: Written wholly in a strange language—Aboleth—and heavily fire damaged, the pages of this book are made from some kind of specially prepared seaweed. The book is a tract railing against the so-called “new gods” and their upstart ways. The text talks about many alien concepts and predicts an inescapable flood will soon wipe away humanity's stain upon the world.
4. Art & Power: A treatise on the use of magic to gain temporal power, this tract is wholly lacking any moral content and simply deals with the matter at hand. Only a few copies of this book survive to the present day; most are held by amoral folk or those who use them as evidence of the dangers of magic in the wrong hands.
5. Lexicon of Shadows: Compiled from many sources, the Lexicon of Shadows deals with the subject of those hated and reviled creatures that can live among human society undetected. The treatise deals with doppelgängers, lycanthropes and the like and warns of the perils of failing to be ever-vigilant against the threat such creatures pose.
6. Unnamed Manuscript: This mass of water-damaged, burnt papers fill a dusty, string-bound leather folder which has fallen down the back of one of the shelves. It is the remains of a copy of an ancient manuscript dealing with the elder demon Amon-Pyr. So hateful and maddening are the text fragments they can snap an unprepared or weak mind.
7. The Final Word: This deranged series of apocalyptic prophecies describe in lurid—and insane—detail the end of the world. The text goes into great detail about the warning signs of impending doom and the events leading up to the world's destruction. Some people suspect the end has already begun and scour the book for details on how to survive the impending apocalypse.
8. Esteri's Workbook: A work by a minor mageling, this thin book presents Esteri's early research into several new spells. One is entitled Esteri's Scorching Burst while another is intriguingly called Esteri's Many Faces. The book is a scrappy, disorganised affair, but beautiful doodles artfully depict what each spell was meant to do.
9. Wondrous Worlds of Infinity: This treatise describes, in beautiful flowing Elven text, the multiverse of planes stretching away from the Prime Material. While no plane is detailed in great depth, this book is an excellent basic primer. The book closes with a list of locations in the world at which the barriers between the planes are particularly weak.
10. The Crown of Flame and Ash (and Other Wondrous and Legendary Objects): Written in a bizarre mix of Dwarven and Elven, this thick book lists in exhaustive detail various artefacts and other objects of legend. The text relates each item's history, assumed powers and known possessors.
11. The Chronicles of the Folk of the Goat-Headed Demon: Centuries ago, a bizarre cult that worshipped a goat-headed demon rose up among the city-states perched upon the edge of an arid desert. The cult tried to weld the various states into an empire, but internecine intrigues doomed the attempt to failure. In the aftermath, a small band of particularly devout adherents to the nameless goat-headed demon disappeared into the desert's arid wastes carrying with them a golden statue said to contain the demon's soul.
12. The Shimmering Horror in the Night: When the stars are right, certain horrible, otherworldly creatures are said to slip into the world from elsewhere. This book details the so-called Shimmering Horror—a creature composed of nothing but strange colours and supernatural cold. The book contains a powerful spell designed to call and bind the Shimmering Horror; mercifully, the spell requires certain hard-to-find components, which means it has not been cast in centuries. 





## EVENTS AMONG THE STACKS 



1. A scholarly, middle-aged man pushes a small trolley laden with books through the stacks. Every now and then, he stops to take a book from the trolley and return it to its rightful spot on the shelf.
2. Quiet whispering comes from behind the stack the character is perusing. A sharp-eared, nosy character interested in what is going on could eavesdrop on the conversation. The whispering could be furtive—perhaps two plotters are meeting in the library—or amorous—a courting couple have met at the library to find some peace and quiet.
3. A gentle breeze enters the library through an open window or door. Dust—dislodged from the covers of several books that have lain undisturbed for years—rains down on the characters.
4. As #3, but instead of being nothing more than a coincidence, the breeze is the result of some unseen force or power attempting to get the characters interested in a certain book. Alternatively, the dust could land on the floor in a particular pattern, such as an arrow pointing in one direction, a holy symbol or the like.
5. Two scholars argue over who gets to read a certain book first. Both have urgent business with the book, and both are impatient fellows full of their own importance. Both also have a hand on the book's cover, and as the argument escalates, they start trying to wrestle over the tome. Eventually, one of the scholars wins and the other staggers back into a bookshelf.
6. A precariously placed, teetering pile of books covers a small side table butted up against a bookcase. Careless characters moving past the table may dislodge the books, which tumble to the floor with a loud series of thumps. Moments later, an irate member of staff appears and demands to know what has happened.
7. Perceptive characters notice a dark shadow creeping across the top of a bookshelf, seemingly intent on something unseen. The shadow is a black cat given the run of the library to keep vermin—mainly rats and mice— at bay. It is friendly and happy to be stroked and petted.
8. A fat middle-aged man sits at a desk muttering to himself as he copies something from a large book. The man—Isto Mielikki—is researching the history of the surrounding settlement and is searching for early maps of the place. (He works for a client who has elected to remain nameless.) If the characters strike up a conversation with Isto he asks them if they know anything about the settlement's early years. Two days after completing his research, Isto is brutally murdered. If the characters hear of this death, they might wonder what he found in the course of his studies…
9. A robe-clad man (Ilja Mietti [N old male human]) works among the stacks sweeping the floor, straightening the shelves and generally making sure the library is clean and tidy. He keeps himself to himself but misses little that happens in the library. He is chatty but crafty and happily tells what he has seen—in return for a small contribution to his retirement fund.
10. A scribe (Aamu Neuvo [LN female human]) bustles past the party laden down with books she is collecting for her patron (Inka Seppo [NG middle-aged female human]) who desires copies of certain land records and histories of the surrounding settlement. Inka is a wealthy widow intent on proving her claim over a piece of nearby land; several of her husband's old rivals are disputing her ownership of the land.
11. A burst of muffled laughter, followed by muttered cursing, comes from nearby. Investigations reveal two bearded middle-aged men moving swiftly toward the library's exit with several books in hand.
12. A sudden stiff breeze blows through the library; pages on open books flutter, and several readers curse as a result of losing their place in the works they were consulting. Moments later, the silence of the library is shattered by a man shouting, “Thief! Stop Thief!”
13. The library's roof is aged and leaking. Shelves under the leaks have been emptied of books, while in other places, iron buckets are placed to catch the drips from above.
14. A trio of obvious adventurers—rough men clad in travelstained leathers and cloaks—stand around a table on which they have unrolled a map of the local area. They are engaged in a quiet, tense conversation.
15. An intense, obviously nervous man stops the party and asks them if anyone knows how to get into the Special Collection. He is exceedingly vague as to his reasons for wishing to peruse the Special Collection's restricted stacks and flees the library if challenged.
16. The pungent smell of mould and rot fills the air around a bookshelf. Investigations reveal the smell emanates from a singular, worm-riddled book of obvious ancient provenance that has been misfiled here.
17. A small, lithe man clutching a wide leather belt in one hand bursts into the library. He is out of breath and has clearly been running. He dashes away from the door. Moments later, a woman, wearing wizard's garb, bursts into the room, spots the man and gives chase.
18. Two children have snuck into the library with the express purpose of causing mischief. They creep about rearranging books, moving furniture into bizarre arrangements and so on. Their occasional sniggering can be heard among the stacks.
19. A book suddenly flies off a shelf and hits a character in the back of the head. Is the library haunted, or is a mischievous prankster at work?
20. A shout of “Fire!” shatters the library's quiet. Smoke billows from a backpack, and panic ensues. 





## FOLK AMONG THE STACKS 



1. KUURA PUUKKO CN middle-aged male human wizard 2 Corpulent and half-crippled, this middle-aged man wears illfitting red robes. Chronically unwell and unfit Kuura blames most of his failures on his various ailments. Kuura works as a scribe and researcher for hire, although he styles himself a sage. Personality: Easily distracted by wine, women or the latest fad, Kuura will never amount to much. In his heart of hearts, he knows this, and it makes him bitter. For all that, he has a keen intellect and could become a puissant wizard if he applied himself to the task. Mannerisms: Kuura has a gamy left leg and walks with a pronounced limp. Hook: Perpetually in need of coin—his expenses far outweigh his income—Kuura introduces himself to the characters and offers his services.
2. EUFROSIINA TORIO LG old female human Stooped and round-shouldered this hunched old woman carries a large bag in one hand and has a look of geniality on her face. Eufrosiina is a well-to-do member of the local community. Her husband is long dead, and the library is now an important part of her life. Personality: Fascinated by history, and a little bit infatuated with one of the library's staff, Eufrosiina is often among the stacks. Genial and well-off, she is keen to natter about almost anything. She is particularly knowledgeable about local history and happily shares her knowledge. Mannerisms: Eufrosiina is tactile and often gently touches those with whom she is speaking (particularly when she has had a drink or two). Hook: A character spots Eufrosiina lurking among the stacks and may grow suspicious as to her behaviour. In truth, she is merely waiting to snatch a few minutes of conversation with the object of her infatuation.
3. BRUSI TALVIKKI NG male human fighter 3 Youthful, broad-shouldered and vigorous, this well-dressed young man looks out of place in the library. A longsword, its hilt worn, hangs from his left hip. Brusi is an adventurer just making a name for himself as a brave—if a little foolhardy—companion. Personality: Brusi is surprisingly cerebral for a warrior and loves to read. History is his passion and he could happily spend days among the stacks reading anything historical he can get his hands on. He particularly loves reading about battles and wars and is more knowledgeable than most sages on such subjects. Mannerisms: When thinking deeply or nervous, Brusi cocks his head to one side. He is also proud of his physique and often stands in a way designed to show off his muscles. Hook: Brusi has just learnt something interesting about an old battlefield and is desperate to share his knowledge— that after the battle a hidden tomb was dug for one of the heroes who fell during the carnage. Brusi wonders if the barrow—and its treasures are still there!
4. AUKU TAPIO N middle-aged male human cleric [Morden] 4 Intricate tattoos cover this bald, bearded man's face and slender arms. Auku follows Morden, the god of magic, and is at the library to gain access to the Special Collection. Thus far, he has been stymied, and he is growing increasingly frustrated. Personality: Full of the belief in his own importance, Auku looks down on those of lesser intellect or achievement. A devout follower of his god, he seeks to increase his knowledge of the mysteries of magic. Mannerisms: Auku has a deep booming voice and makes expansive gestures when making an important point. Hook: Auku accosts a character and begins to rant about the library and its staff. If he discovers the party have gained access to the Special Collection he loudly demands to know how they managed such a seemingly impossible feat.
5. INKERI VAITO LN middle-aged female human Brown pigtails frame this stout, plain-looking woman's face. She wears simple, floor-length robes. Inkeri works at the library and brooks no abuse of its books or its rules. In her own mind, the library is her domain and she defends it zealously. Personality: Unimaginative, but dogged, Inkeri works hard to maintain the library and its collections. She craves order and hates chaos and confusion. She also dislikes loud noises and surprises. Mannerisms: Inkeri speaks slowly and clearly, and hates to repeat herself. Hook: If Inkeri comes to believe the characters are guilty of transgressing the library's rules, she dogs their every move and actively looks for a reason to throw them out. 





## THINGS AMONG THE STACKS 



1. As if dropped, a single book lies open, cover up, on the floor. A perceptive character notices specks of fresh blood on the cover. A smear of blood mars the open pages. Characters searching around in the vicinity of the dropped book discover a bloody handprint on one shelf and might even discover a faint trail of blood drops leading off deeper into the library.
2. Perceptive characters notice a small section of books juts out slightly further from the wall than the surrounding tomes. Investigating behind the books discovered a small scroll sealed with wax. Only by breaking the seal can the party discover what message the scroll holds. Perhaps a spy has left a message here for their contact or the scroll is a love note between illicit lovers.
3. The worn and dusty statuette of a curled-up cat serves as a bookend to a short section of books. Under the dust, the cat's onyx eyes glimmer like pools of black fire. The statuette could be nothing more than a bookend or it could be an atypical figurine of wondrous power placed here years ago and promptly forgotten.
4. A small wooden desk fills a niche set between two bookshelves. Open books lie scattered across the desk. A cursory glance suggests the person using the desk is researching evil cults. However, of the reader, there is no sign (although a small satchel under the desk may contain clues to their identity).
5. An iron torch sconce juts from the end of one bookcase. The sconce is wrought in the shape of an ornate scroll tube with a fan of papers emerging from one end. A torch wreathed in magical flame pokes out from among the papers.
6. Dusty windows high up in one wall—or perhaps the ceiling—let faint light in from outside. The dust on the windows is thicker in some places than in others which creates an interesting pattern on the floor below.
7. As #6 above but the windows are of stained glass wrought to glorify Morden the god of knowledge and magic. The faint light filtering through the glass creates a multi-hued pattern on the floor. Once a year, on the night most scared to the god the multi-hued light comes to rest on a certain flagstone now partially obscured by a bookshelf. A secret niche under the flagstone holds a spellbook filled with unique or rare spells.
8. Faded, dusty tapestries hang from the library's walls. Some depict maps of the surrounding area while one presents a stylised view of the entire continent.
9. Graffiti carved into the wood of a bookshelf reads, “For the ultimate knowledge, seek the rose.”
10. Wet footsteps mar the library's floor. Strangely, they start at one bookshelf and end in a nearby study niche.
11. A tall statue of a winged warrior woman stands on a plinth, overlooking the library. The statue is clearly old; the woman is missing the tip of her nose and her sword is shattered low down near its hilt. The statue has stood here for years, and no one knows for certainty who or what it represents.
12. Several portraits of stern, well-to-do folk hang from the walls. All were clearly wealthy or important in some way. Intermingled with portraits are three pictures of legendary places as imagined by a wild, macabre artist. Each—a lava-spewing mountain, a ruin-topped island emerging from a raging sea and a great rift disappearing into shadow-filled depths—has an air of malignant threat about them. 





# BANDITS & BRIGANDS 





1. EETU ILMA Recently turned to a life of banditry, Eetu is keen to prove himself to his new “friends”. Wearing dirty armour and travel-stained clothes this burly man looks like he has lived in the wilds for some time. He has long, unkempt jet-black hair and black eyes. Eetu (NE male human fighter 1) is new to the gang; several weeks ago he was forced to flee his home after nearly beating a neighbour to death over some trivial matter. Personality: Eetu doesn't see why he should work; might is right and he can simply take what he wants from others. He likes inflicting pain, but hasn't actually killed anyone yet—but that's not through lack of trying. Mannerisms: Eetu has an intense, aggression-filled stare which he fixes on his enemy. Hook: Obsessed with revenge against the man he blames for his current lot, Eetu plots a midnight return to his home village to even the score.
2. KOSTI EHTARO A murderer and rapist, Kosti is feared by his friends and enemies alike. Thin and wiry this man exudes energy and malice. He wears a dirty cloak with a deep hood and gently rests a hand on his dagger's pommel. Kosti (CE male human fighter 2) is a thoroughly foul and odious individual. He has few friends in the gang and soon his fellows will grow tired of him and eject him from the band. He will not go quietly. Personality: Consumed with his own lusts, he cares nothing for others except in regard to what they can do for or give him. Mannerisms: Kosti has named his dagger, “Eye Gouger” and is always sharpening or polishing the weapon. Hook: Kosti has a grudge to settle with Venla Koira, who last week stopped him raping a woman the gang accosted. In the confusion of battle, he seeks to even the score.
3. HEDVIG KULTA A reluctant bandit, Hedvig is plotting to steal from her gang and flee in search of a better life far away. Tall and rangy with a weatherworn face this half-elven radiates competence as well as weariness. Hedvig (CN female half-elf ranger 2) is as capricious and wild as the winter wind. She loves the outdoors but grows tired of a bandit's life. She has also seen how her companions treat their captives—particularly women—and is becoming increasingly uncomfortable in the gang. Personality: Hedvig has no problem with some light thievery, but she is not evil. Killing, except in self-defence, feels wrong to her and she worries she may be forced to kill someone soon. Mannerisms: Hedvig often lapses into silence, and stares off into space seemingly focusing on nothing. Some of her fellow bandits find this off-putting and rude. Hook: Hedvig is plotting to betray her fellows. She plans to steal the gang's choicest treasures and escape to a better life. She does not like the ever-present threat of the hangman's noose and dreams of a better, purer life.
4. PEKKO MIEMO This snivelling man does not want to be here at all. Lank black hair frames a wan face set into a gloomy look of acceptance. Several bruises mar his face. He wears crude, padded armour and carries a spear. Pekko (N male human fighter 1) was given a stark choice; join the gang or die. Unsurprisingly, he chose to join up and bitterly regrets his current lot. Personality: It's always someone else's fault and he's normally the helpless victim—at least that's how Pekko sees things. Why take responsibility for your actions, when you can pass them on to someone else? Mannerisms: Pekko often sighs before speaking and rarely gets animated or excited about anything. Hook: Sent out on business by his master, Pekko fell into the bandits' clutches. He blames his master for his current lot and cannot wait to wreak his revenge.
5. JYRKI SUSI Dirty and unkempt, Jyrki cares only for himself and his pet. This unkempt, dirty-faced man wears a filthy tunic. Face screwed up in a squint, he seems surprised or confused. Jyrki (NE male human fighter 1) has terrible table manners— for him, eating is a full-contact sport; the front of his jerkin and chin are splattered with the remnants of his last meal. He has a pet weasel with whom he shares his food. Personality: A tad forgetful and often distracted, Jyrki is prone to making assumptions. Arrogant and hateful, he is an unpleasant fellow. He only loves his pet and cares more for it than he does for any of his companions. Mannerisms: Jyrki is always digging in an ear or nostril for something tasty. Hook: Jyrki mistakes one of the characters for a childhood friend and calls out to them. If the characters fall into the bandits' hands, he protects the character in question until he discovers his mistake. Then, he savagely beats the character to punish them for deceiving him. 
6. ANTTI VÄINÖ One-eyed bandit veteran of many years living in the wilderness and preying on travellers. A ragged, dirty bandage covers this man's right eye. He wears his hair closely cropped at the sides and slicked back on top. Antti (CE middle-aged male half-orc fighter 2) is a veteran bandit who has survived the destruction or disbandment of many bandit gangs. He has a finely-honed survival instinct and no loyalty whatsoever to his companions. Personality: Coarse, simple and violent, Antti is in some ways the perfect bandit. He believes might is right and cares nothing for those falling into his clutches. For him, mercy equates to leaving his victims alive and partially clothed. Mannerisms: When nervous, Antti reaches under his bandage and rubs his empty right eye socket. Hook: Antti believes the gang is doomed and is sneaking out of the camp when the characters attack.
7. MIELIKKI URO Sneaky, duplicitous and manipulative, Mielikki wants to overthrow the gang's boss. Tall, and muscular, this brown-haired woman exudes confidence. She wears tightly cut studded leather armour. Mielikki (CE female human thief 2) knows she's destined for bigger, better things. Personality: Mielikki hates weak people, seeing them as nothing more than sheep to be preyed on. She uses others without guilt and lives for the moment. Mannerisms: With a laugh like a hyena, Mielikki often gloats loudly over those in her power. Hook: Mielikki plans to seduce and then kill the gang's leader. She uses the characters' arrival to ingratiate herself with her target.
8. VENLA KOIRA Heavy debts forced Venla into a life of banditry and wildliving. To her surprise, she has found she enjoys the life. Skinny and lithe, this woman wears her brown hair closely cropped; she wears large bronze bangle-style earrings. Venla (CE female human fighter 3) enjoys the bandit lifestyle —particularly being unshackled from society's rules. Personality: Living in the moment, Venla is wild and unpredictable. She doesn't enjoy violence for violence's sake —viewing it as nothing more than a means to an end. Mannerisms: Quick to laugh and quick to anger, Venla wears her emotions openly. Hook: One of the characters takes Venla's fancy. If the party fall into the bandits' hands she tries to have her way with the object of her lust. 





## CAMP DRESSING 



1. A crude, waist-high wall of tree branches, tree stumps and the like surrounds the camp. The barrier will not keep out determined intruders, but provides cover for the camp's defenders—and keeps some wandering animals away.
2. A hodgepodge of tents, lean-to shelters and so on stand haphazardly throughout the camp seemingly without any order or plan. Small campfires smoulder in front of many of the tents.
3. The skinned and dressed carcasses of several woodland animals—a brace of rabbits, several squirrels and a deer hang from an A-frame near a central cooking fire.
4. One part of the camp is given over to a meeting place of sorts with tree trunks arranged as crude benches around a central fire pit. A stack of firewood lies nearby.
5. Trash and rubbish are scattered on the ground outside, and within, the camp. A short distance away, the bandits have dug a series of latrine pits in a sunken hollow. Even unwary intruders smell the latrines before blundering into them.
6. A larger tent—what looks to have once been a noble's pavilion—rises above the rest in the centre of the camp. Herein dwells the bandit chieftain.
7. Wisps of smoke from the camp's many campfires drift upwards through the trees; the sunlight slanting down from above creates many shiv lights giving the camp a strange, almost otherworldly feel.
8. A shallow ditch—a half-hearted attempt at a moat —runs along a short portion of the camp's boundary; the lazy bandits gave up soon after starting their work; a few rusting shovels and a mattock lie on the ground nearby.
9. Well trodden earthen paths wend their way toward and through the camp; obviously, the bandits have laired here for some time.
10. An empty wagon—without a horse—stands under a tree; an awning hangs down over the wagon, obscuring what lies beneath (a pair of bedrolls set up “dangerously” close together by a pair of courting bandits).
11. A large empty barrel stands near the main fire pit. An axe is embedded in its lid and dried blood covers both the axe and the barrel. Here, the bandits butcher rabbits, deer and other creatures caught in the locality.
12. Under a pine's low branches, a thick tarpaulin covers a large pile of firewood stacked close to the central fire pit.
13. A short distance outside the camp, several crude grave markers show where several of the gang have been laid to rest. The dead could have succumbed to battle injuries, a freak accident or virulent disease. The markers do not record names or causes of death.
14. A knotted rope hangs from the boughs of a large tree growing on the camp's fringes. A makeshift platform among the tree's branches serves as a concealed lookout spot.
15. Four cows and two sheep are penned in a small makeshift enclosure in the camp. They are the proceeds of recent raids and will soon be slaughtered for meat.
16. Six shuttered lanterns hang from the branches of various trees scattered about the camp. At night, the lanterns are lit—except when enemies are in the locality.
17. The ground is slightly sloped; the bandits have dug flat areas into the hillside for their tents.
18. A large oak stands at the centre of the camp, its heavy branches reaching down almost to the ground. It is dry, but dim, under the tree's canopy. Graffiti mars the oak's wide, gnarled trunk.
19. The camp stands amid the ancient, tumbled walls of some ruin now swallowed by trees, brambles and weeds. The bandits have piled branches and fallen trees against breaches in the old walls.
20. The bandits have set tripwires designed to make a loud noise around their camp. Only three pathways into the camp are devoid of traps. 





## BANDIT LOOT 



1. Sacks, boxes and barrels hold food, wine and other staples. With the exception of the barrels and casks holding wine and other drinks (which are kept near the leader's tent), the rest are scattered through the camp.
2. Several horses are tethered to hitching poles driven deep into the earth. The horses stand under a crude shelter of woven tree branches; bits, bridles and saddles lie nearby.
3. Several sacks hold bolts of fresh linen and other cloth; a small bolt of white silk is hidden at the bottom of one of the sacks. The silk is worth 20 gp—easily more than the rest of the cloth combined.
4. One of the bandits is lucky enough to have a canvas tent of particularly good design large enough to sleep three people. It is essentially rainproof and a great boon to those travelling in the wilderness.
5. Three suits of chainmail languish in the leader's tent; she intends to gift them to trusted members of the band—but hasn't yet decided who is worthy of such treasures.
6. A holy symbol decorates the cover of this large leathercovered book. It is a holy book of the local faith stolen from a wandering priest.
7. The bandits recently captured Alpo Lemminkäinen (LG male human cleric 1), a wandering acolyte of the local religion, and have sent a message to his church demanding a ransom. The message was sent two weeks ago, and the bandits are growing tired of waiting for a reply. Meanwhile, they force Alpo to serve them around the camp and to use his spells for the group's benefit.
8. A tinker's wagon stands in the camp. The wagon holds a vast selection of agricultural equipment along with pewter bowls, cups and so on. Packed in sawdust and straw in a large wrought iron cauldron lie a dozen bottles of fine wine once destined for a noble's table.
9. A beautifully carved set of gargoyles stand on a low wagon. Destined for a local noble's home, the gargoyles look to be horrifying demons. They are stoutly tied down to the wagon—perhaps too stoutly…
10. A small heap of blankets and commoners' clothing fills one of the bandits' tents. None of the items are particularly valuable, but cunning bandits could have hidden something within the pile.
11. Two sealed barrels each contain eight gallons of lamp oil. The symbol of a shuttered lantern is burnt onto each barrel's lid.
12. A bundle of furs fills a chest in the leader's tent; amid the rabbit, beaver and fox pelts is a large black bear's pelt— complete with the creatures' head. 



## LOOTING THE BODY 



1. One silver teardrop earring worth 2 gp hangs from the bandit's left ear. The bandit's long, lank black hair hides the earring from a casual search.
2. A battered tinderbox, 4 sp, a short length of twine and a whetstone fill the bandit's pouch.
3. In his boot, the bandit has hidden a dagger with a curious curved blade design. The weapon is obviously old and is missing its tip.
4. This bandit had a short length of red silk hidden behind his belt. (He took the scrap of silk from an ex-lover to remember her by).
5. A thick leather cloak with a deep cowl fills the bandit's backpack along with other odds and ends including a waterskin, a day's worth of rations and a small sack.
6. This bandit collected daggers; he has four hanging from his belt and one shoved into each boot. His belt pouch contains a whetstone and small dirty rag along with a small oil flask.
7. This bandit wore a leather necklace on a thong around his neck. Four small silver charms—misshapen leaves—or perhaps clover leaves—hang from the thong. The charms are worth 3 gp as a set.
8. A small sketchbook and several sharpened chunks of charcoal fill a small sack stuffed into the bandit's pack. Pictures of local wildlife scenes as well as scenes of village life fill much of the book.
9. A book with a torn cover contains a series of local tales, legends and songs. The book once belonged to a bard— it was his commonplace book—until he fell afoul of the group. Its current owner has added a few stories of his own—the change in handwriting (for the worse) is noticeable toward the end of the book.
10. A pair of fine leather gloves are tucked into this bandit's belt, Clearly, they are not his; monogrammed initials— A.H.—decorate both gloves. The bandit also has a beautifully carved pipe and a pouch of expensive tobacco. The pipe looks like a dragon—the pipe's smoke issues from its mouth.
11. The bandit wears a slender golden ring on the smallest finger on their left hand. The ring is of elven artifice and beautifully wrought, but this is not immediately evident as it is covered in dirt to make it look virtually valueless. (Perhaps he feared a companion would steal it.)
12. Tucked under his jerkin, this bandit wears a primitive tribal necklace—something a barbarian, goblin or orc might wear. The necklace could foreshadow another local threat the characters might soon meet; the necklace could be a piece of war booty or a gift— depending on whether the bandits are friendly with their “neighbours” or not. 





## COMPLICATIONS & OPPORTUNITIES 



1. One of the bandits is plotting against the group's leader and uses the characters' interference in the gang's affairs to set her plan in motion. Either through action or inaction, the bandit seeks the death of the gang leader and lordship over the band's survivors.
2. The characters arrive at the camp as the bandits are preparing to move out. Thus, the bandits have broken down their tents, loaded up their pack animals and their leaders are mounted and ready to go. When the characters attack, the leaders flee with the packhorses carrying all the group's loot leaving the gang's rank and file to face the intruders.
3. The characters are not the only ones hunting the bandits. A rival gang or patrol of soldiers arrive shortly after the characters attack the camp. Soldiers likely attempt to claim the bandits' loot as property of their lord while the new bandits may attack the party if the characters seem weak. Finally, the soldiers may need convincing the characters are not bandits themselves.
4. A virulent disease ravages the bandit camp; when the characters arrive many of the gang are suffering its effects. If the plague is airborne, the party could become infected during the inevitable fighting their arrival heralds. In serious outbreaks, the bandits could be suffering from the plague. Some characters may not feel comfortable returning to the nearby town or village until they can ascertain whether they are infected.
5. As #4 above except the outbreak is no accident. A local lord arranged for the bandits to take three wagons piled high with corn, grain or cloth. Several infected rats lurked among the trade goods and it is they who have infected the camp. (The characters may encounter the rats as they move through the camp.)
6. The bandit chieftain has just been challenged—illadvisedly— by one of his minions for leadership of the band. Most of the bandits are distracted by the ensuing fight when the characters arrive. 





# BESIEGED CASTLE 







## MINOR EVENTS 




### DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. A messenger pigeon avoids an arrow storm, but relief at the bird's survival is short-lived. It arrives with dire news: a week-long delay for reinforcements and supplies.
2. A mercenary band arrives to offer their services at an exorbitant fee. However, they prove more than capable as fighters and boast an elven sharpshooting archer who can easily pick off foes at great range. If rebuffed, they threaten to make a similar offer to the enemy.
3. Steady rain has turned the surrounding land into a mire, which gives the defenders a break from battering rams and other direct attacks from siege engines. However, the enemy forces continue to use catapults.
4. A kettle of vultures circles overhead, potentially unnerving those in the castle or among the besieging army. Alternatively, an unkindness of ravens or another group of portentous (either good- or ill-omened) birds flocks to the ramparts and begins calling loudly.
5. One of the castle's towers collapses, providing the besieging army with easy access to the castle. As the siege-laying army clambers over the rubble, defenders must turn them away and strive to make the pile of rubble unclimbable.
6. A lightning strike or errant ember ignites dry vegetation. The fire builds and threatens to sweep across the battlefield. While the castle acts as an inherent buffer against the fire, smoke inhalation or fiery material carried aloft by the wind pose threats to the defenders.
7. Strong winds blow away from the castle toward the enemy (or vice versa). Powerful gusts render the use of incendiary munitions a dangerous prospect.
8. A well-respected leader of the castle garrison dies in battle, from natural causes or through foul play. Regardless of the circumstances, members of the guard must quickly pay their respects to their fallen leader. If the cause of death is suspect, it prompts an investigation, provided it does not interfere with the castle's defence.
9. A seemingly neutral party arrives under the flag of peace to negotiate the cessation of hostilities. Their purpose for doing so may be purely altruistic or may conceal sinister intentions for either side of the conflict.
10. A massive crack forms in the castle's foundation due to the strain of repeated attacks by siege engines or through a shift in the underlying earth. A team of engineers must repair the crack before it spreads and creates a breach through which the invaders can pour. 

### NIGHT-TIME EVENTS 



1. The full moon, previously cloaked by clouds, becomes free of its obscurement and gives the defenders a clear view of the enemy encampment.
2. An explosion shakes the castle. The explosion's source is unclear even to the night watch, but the castle appears undamaged. A fraught wait until morning ensues before the defenders can make a true assessment.
3. A small group from the besieging army attempts to infiltrate the castle. They plan to scout the castle's defences, inhibit the defenders' ability to hold off the siege or create an opening (or enlarge an existing one) so a larger force can break in.
4. The night grows quiet, as the enemy seems to settle down for the night. Suddenly, wolf howls from near the castle break the silence. Are the wolves preying on the besiegers or part of their forces?
5. A member of the besieging encampment loudly plays a discordant tune on a brass instrument. The instrument's player keeps the racket up for the entire night, and the sound penetrates even the densest castle walls. The rest of the encampment is either used to the noise or uses wax or another means to deaden it.
6. A group of commoners displaced by the conflict threads its way through the enemy encampment. The people seek shelter in the castle and offer to help in any way they can, but their numbers threaten the already dwindling supplies. A spy or assassin could lurk among the refugees.
7. A meteorite streaks across the night sky. Augurs from both sides try to ascertain whether its appearance bodes good or evil. Likewise, a partial or full lunar eclipse, or the appearance of a comet or other celestial event, might provoke concern about its portent.
8. Members of the night watch hear the sounds of construction from behind a copse. Campfire light necessary for the builders to see their work illuminates the top of a siege engine visible over the tallest trees.
9. Sappers begin, or continue, digging a tunnel under the castle. They have chosen a location where their digging cannot be heard or do their work while a louder sound (for example, the cacophonous instrument playing in #5) conceals their toil.
10. Rain (either a continuation of daytime event #3 or a fresh storm) douses campfires and makes conditions miserable for the besiegers. Fortunately, the castle provides a respite for everyone but the night watch. 











## ATTACKS 



1. Warriors run toward the castle walls carrying long ladders. Some of the attackers carry tower shields, and these warriors are first up the ladders. They hold the shields above their heads to protect themselves from the defenders' missiles. On the ground, archers unleash a storm of arrows to keep the defenders' heads down.
2. The attackers draw up several wagons filled with wood, straw and other combustible materials. Much of the material piled into the wagon is damp. When the wind blows in the right direction—toward the castle—they set the wagons aflame. Smoke billows from the wagons, which the attackers begin to push toward the castle walls. Behind the wagons, obscured in the smoke, lurks the assault force.
3. At dusk, the enemy draws up a large force opposite one of the castle's walls. The warriors make a lot of noise— banging their weapons on their shields, taunting the defenders, singing and so on. The spectacle goes on as night falls. The display is a diversion—several enemy champions creep toward another wall intent on using stealth to enter the castle. Once inside, they plan to open the main gates for their fellows.
4. The attackers dig a tunnel to undermine a wall or tower. Observant characters—or perhaps those sent out to disrupt the enemy camp—spot the tunnel entrance, or the hidden piles of spoils near the tunnel. When the tunnel is finished, the sappers plan to pack it with oilsoaked wood and set it on fire. The resultant collapse should cause a breach in the castle's defences.
5. The enemy pile a wagon full of barrels of oil and other highly flammable substances. To dissuade the castle defenders from shooting at the wagon, they tie (or nail) captives taken from the surrounding locality to the front and sides of the wagon. When the enemy are ready to attack, heavily armoured warriors push the wagon towards the castle gates.
6. As number 5 above, but instead of captives, the enemy has “armoured” the wagon by nailing many shields to its sides, front and over its wheels.
7. Using sword and flame, the attacking troops drive a huge herd of cattle at the castle gates. They hope either the panicked animals will sunder the gate in their panic to escape or the heaps of dead animals will pile so high they can use them to scale the walls.
8. The enemy use catapults to hurl balls of pitch-soaked flaming hay bales and the like against the castle walls. The flaming missiles do no damage but create dense clouds of smoke which hide an imminent attack.
9. The enemy have many captives and slaves. They set the captives free and drive them toward the castle. They then charge forward. Quickly, the two groups become intermingled, making it hard for the defenders to target the enemy without injuring or killing the innocents desperately trying to reach the safety of the castle.
10. Pairs of allied (perhaps mercenary) giants carry wagons full of enemy warriors toward the castle walls, which they plan to lift up onto the battlements. The warriors within are equipped with heavy shields and lengths of knotted rope. They plan to clear a stretch of the wall, let down their ropes and hold the breach until their fellows arrive.
11. The besieging force uses catapults to hurl the diseased bodies of animals—and perhaps even their own dead— over the castle walls.
12. The besieging force sends a small group to offer parley and to ask for the garrison's surrender. This is a trick, and a small band of elite warriors use the distraction to creep toward a lightly defended section of the wall. 

## DEFENCES AND COUNTERATTACKS 



1. A water-filled moat is one of the surest defences against battering rams and other siege engines used to directly attack the castle. If a moat proves impractical, a small team can dig strategically placed trenches and cover them with natural material to conceal them. Additionally, breaking up the ground around the castle hinders ladder placement.
2. Several cauldrons stand in the castle grounds fed by wood- and coal-burning fires. While the inhabitants may have to suffer cold nights, the cauldrons filled with water, sand or oil provide a deadly threat to invaders using scaling ladders.
3. A supply of quarried stones acts as ammunition for catapults situated within the castle. These stones can destroy opposing siege engines or flatten swaths of enemy combatants. In dire situations, livestock or corpses can serve as missiles.
4. Rounding castle walls helps deflect battering rams and makes the walls less susceptible to breaches. Though less effective, grease, liquid fat or other slick substances create a similar effect in a pinch.
5. Battlements grant protection for archers, allowing the defenders to take advantage of higher ground without fear of reprisal. Rubble and planks of wood serve as weaker protection. Hoardings provide greater protection from missile weapons and enable defenders to move about unseen.
6. Many castles fall prey to invaders tunnelling under the walls. Extending the foundation is difficult even with ample warning, but a few stone blocks in easily compromised areas thwart quick access. Defenders can also use cauldrons of water to fill tunnels and drown would-be intruders and set up traps to protect obvious entry points.
7. Many siege engines are constructed primarily of wood; arrows or ballistae bolts coated with pitch and set aflame are useful agents of their destruction.
8. Erecting redundant outer and inner walls of increasing height allows the castle to absorb hits from siege engines, wears down enemies scaling the walls and accelerates attrition of enemy forces.
9. Both the besieging army and the castle's defenders use messenger birds to inform their leaders of events and to request reinforcements or resupply. Archers on both sides wait to shoot down the birds. Employing trained birds of prey to attack smaller birds is similarly useful.
10. Castle defenders can allow themselves to become the enemy's prisoners. While imprisoned, they can gain intelligence on their enemy's numbers and capabilities. Escaping with their findings while not divulging counterintelligence is crucial for this tactic's success.
11. A small band of defenders creeps out at night to dig small holes along the attackers' expected line of attack, in the hopes of disrupting their charge. The diggers need guards, and the characters are asked to accompany them.
12. The defenders have a small supply of enemy equipment and uniforms. Volunteers are asked to join an intelligence-gathering sortie into the enemy camp. 





## CHALLENGES & COMPLICATIONS 




### DWINDLING SUPPLIES 



1. Iron & Coal: The castle's blacksmith is hard at work repairing the garrison's arms and armour and forging new arrowheads, crossbow bolt tips and the like. Unfortunately, this frenzy of activity is eating into his stock of raw materials—iron bars, coal and the like. (The castle's bowyer/fletcher, leatherworker and other essential crafters could also be in a similar situation).
2. Animal Fodder: More beasts of burden and horses are stabled within the castle than normal. Supplies of animal fodder are running low and soon the stablemaster must slaughter some of the animals.
3. Healing Supplies: A constant stream of wounded soldiers and the like make their way to the castle's healers—either clerics, apothecaries or army surgeons. This constant demand is depleting the healers' supplies of bandages, unguents and the like. Alternatively, the castle's clerics could be running low on consumable magic items such as potions and scrolls.
4. Wine & Ale: The castle is running low on wine and ale to slake the defenders' thirst. During particularly harrowing times, the castle's lord uses both drinks to boost the morale and bravery of his soldiers. When the castle runs dry, a mutiny—or collapse in morale—could ensue.
5. Oil & Torches: A constant watch must be kept— particularly during the hours of darkness when evil's forces are at their most dangerous. This requires much lamp oil and prepared torches for the castle's human defenders are at a disadvantage in the dark.
6. Firewood: The castle needs wood for its fires to boil water, cook food, light the blacksmith's forge and for heat. Wood is bulky, and the castle's supply is running low. Will someone slip over the wall to get more? (And if they do, how will they retrieve a decent supply?)
7. Pigeons: The castle has a small supply of messenger pigeons, but is running low as most have been despatched with requests for reinforcements, more supplies and the like. Can the characters sneak through the enemy lines to retrieve more birds?
8. Masonry & Mortar: Enemy action has damaged parts of the castle's ramparts and crenellations. The castle's supply of masonry and mortar is running low as the stonemasons patch up one piece of damage after another. (Alternatively, the castle could be running low on planks and other prepared wood as they use it to repair gates, hoardings and so on).
9. Compassion & Caring: Surrounded and under constant attack, the morale of the castle's garrison and those seeking shelter within, is falling. Arguments become more common, and small fights erupt over trivial matters. Someone must calm the situation before it spirals out of control.
10. Fresh Air: With so many bodies crammed into a small space, and the reduction in sanitation, coupled with the decomposing bodies of the dead and the fires of the besieging forces wafting over the castle, a miasma of death hangs over the fortress. Sickness and plague could result unless something is done. 

### LOW MORALE 



1. Several defenders wish to surrender. The castle's commander must assuage their fears and inspire them to keep fighting.
2. Tempers flare among the castle's guardians and fights break out, with each side blaming the other for failures and losses suffered during the siege. The situation requires intervention to restore calm within the ranks.
3. Defenders sneak out of the castle at night to make a deal with the besiegers, hoping to trade safety for intelligence on the defences. The traitors have convinced themselves the castle is doomed, so they hope to spare themselves from certain death.
4. Rumours about horrible treatment by the enemy spread among the defenders. While this might seem to bolster resolve among them, they instead suffer sleepless nights as their imaginations run wild considering the torture awaiting them should the castle fall.
5. The castle's defenders believe the decisions made by their leaders are lacking, so they plan to overthrow them.
6. The defenders threaten to strike for better conditions or pay for their work. Their threats intensify and their demands become more unreasonable as the siege's duration stretches from days to weeks.
7. Rumours circulate among the castle's inhabitants about a supernatural enemy among the besiegers. This intensifies the inhabitants' fear and degrades their ability to keep fighting.
8. Members of the night watch feel taken advantage of since they must remain alert overnight while others benefit from the luxury of sleep. They become less attentive and more prone to napping during their watch.
9. Low morale spreads to the officers, who second guess their decisions and poll their followers for advice on how to handle the siege. This forces the followers to take matters into their own hands or requires the lord or lady of the castle to replace the ineffective leaders.
10. People begin to hoard food out of fear of dwindling supplies. Arguments about food rationing become more frequent. In extreme cases, someone poisons or purposely spoils the food so no one can eat it. 





# BUSTLING MARKETPLACE 







## DIFFERENT PLACES FOR A MARKET 



1. On the Docks: In this aquatic locale, traders sail (or row) to the marketplace. They moor on the docks and display their wares on the decks of their vessels. A market of this sort enables traders to travel much further to show off their produce. Those visiting the market can do so on foot or if they wish to dodge the congested gangways they can hire (or use) their own waterborne transport.
2. On a Bridge: Bridges are excellent spots for small markets. Travellers must pass every stall, making it easy for the traders to hawk their wares. Many medieval bridges had buildings on them—built out over the water! Traders with stalls on bridges could even trade with vessels passing under the bridge, perhaps using baskets on ropes to lower goods to their customers.
3. In a Church: Often, churches are some of the largest buildings in a town or city. If the deity has trade or industry in its portfolio it makes perfect sense for it to host a market. The market might not be daily, but it could be weekly—in fact depending on the faith's exact beliefs running a market could in i t s e l f be a form of veneration. A market in a church is unaffected by weather a n d — o f c o u r s e — t h e clergy of the faith would guarantee the safety of the traders and their customers. Under the clergy's watchful eyes, petty crime might also be much reduced making it a safe place to trade or visit.
4. In a Ruin: Large ruins make a perfect venue for a ma r ke t . S u c h unused places offer more safety and shelter than that offered by the town square. Assuming such a place has an obvious entrance, it means those putting on the market can charge an entry fee for the traders and/or their customers. Such locales are often safer than a normal market square as thieves don't like a restricted number of escape routes.
5. Underground: Some markets might be literally underground. Of course, the most likely market of this ilk is one dealing in illicit or stolen goods. Other markets may be underground because the traders prefer the darkness—perhaps a dwarven hold trading with the humans in the city above. Also, simply, there may be no space in the city above big enough to hold the market.
6. Combined Market: Combine two of the market locales detailed above or add one to a standard marketplace. Remember when designing your market that some markets can be specialised while others are more generalised. For example: • A market set underground might deal only or primarily with the fruits of the Ebon Realm. • A market set in a church may deal with items of religious interest such as holy relics, blessed water and so on. • A market set on a dock may deal with the fruits of the sea —fresh fish, crabs and so on—as well as acting as a place for petty merchants to buy direct from the merchants importing goods to the town. 





## INTERESTING STALLS 



1. A greasy man with thin black hair sells live black bats for familiars, arcane components or kibble. The bats chirp and flutter energetically, straining at the leg straps tying them to their perches. Three tattooed elves purchase from the vendor, completing their transactions in silence.
2. A fat dwarf in a dirty grey shirt runs a stall stocked with hundreds of rotten caramel apples. He absentmindedly bites a soft apple, makes a face of disgust, and then puts it back. The dwarf's white beard drips with melted sugar, apple juices and black seeds.
3. Two elven children, a boy and a girl, sell beaded talismans from a stall shoved to the back of the market. They aggressively hock their wares but attract little more than annoyed glances from other merchants. A large dwarf swipes a talisman without paying and walks away as if he cannot hear the children's angry protests.
4. A female gnome, either drugged or incredibly scatterbrained, sells glass baubles. She mumbles quietly to herself, blanks eyes staring up at the sky. However, her wares radiate a complex magical aura noticeable to even the most mundane passer-by.
5. A thin human in a black cloak wrings his hands and mutters to himself. He seems suspiciously eager to rid himself of his stock of rings, bracelets and other fine jewellery. The interlocking scars running down his forearm look more like ritualistic injuries than wounds.
6. A sickly half-orc repeatedly sneezes over his merchandise: meat pies and sandwiches. He makes no effort to clean up the mucus, instead sipping a spicysmelling tea and wiping his bleary eyes. Despite everything, the meat pies smell of pepper, salt and garlic, and the hearty aroma is delicious. A few faithful customers purchase a snack, brush off the phlegm and eat the meals wholeheartedly.
7. A handsome half-elf merchant flirts with a well-dressed noblewoman. She pockets some of the merchant's jewellery when he is distracted, kisses the half-elf on the cheek then turns to leave. The blushing vendor doesn't notice a thing.
8. A tired halfling leafs through one of the many books he has for sale, and barely seems to notice his customers. He adjusts his spectacles and licks his fingers whenever he needs to turn the page, and loudly clears his throat every few moments.
9. Behind a counter lined with mosses and herbs, a mute orc tries to haggle for various natural medicines. When her customer leaves in frustration, she lobs a handful of mud at the back of his head and makes a rude gesture. Evidently, no deal was reached.
10. A strange-looking human with pale flesh and massive eyes sells rare spell components. His accent cannot be placed, and he repeatedly scratches his face. However, his smile and voice charm customers, who cannot help but purchase his wares.
11. A fast-talking human has attracted a crowd by extolling the medicinal virtues of various charms won from tribes in the undiscovered wilds. Despite the slick look of the merchant, the goods appear to be genuine—or at least, alien to those produced by local artisans.
12. A brooding teenage human with facial tattoos, and an obvious great disdain for his customers, sells a small variety of wands. Though he makes no attempt to attract passers-by, he scoffs and rolls his eyes when a potential client chooses to move on.
13. A smiling gnome in a yellow dress sells bizarre, eldritch flowers from a small handbag. Many of the flowers move seemingly with a life of their own. She wanders the market, approaching and aggressively selling to anybody who makes eye contact.
14. A dwarf loudly hocks vials of silty water, which he claims are from a blessed spring. A pale, sweaty customer purchases a vial, gags on the liquid and is reassured by the dwarf that the magic is already doing its work.
15. Identical halfling twins put on a short juggling show in an attempt to drive business. The act is entertaining, but their stock of overpriced potions goes mostly ignored. They put on a brave face as the crowd dissipates, but seem stressed.
16. An old woman with black cataracts sells fresh scrolls, penned by her own unsteady hand. Despite shaky script, dozens of customers put down handfuls of coin and thank the lady profusely. She smiles and shakes each one by the hand.
17. An obese half-orc with a malformed leg loudly extolls his wares: fine-looking axes and crossbows of apparent dwarven make. Suspicious dwarves glare at the half-orc but say nothing. Closer inspection, reveals the weapons bear the marks of orc craftsmen.
18. A dwarf plays an intense game of cards with a street ruffian, completely ignoring potential customers who walk past his stall. Evidently, his business of potted plants is not doing well. The street ruffian, a human no older than eight, has won several consecutive hands and is coming away with a few handfuls of coppers. The dwarf is clearly getting angry.
19. A gaunt, impossibly tall human hunches in his stall, gesturing at his wares with long fingers and a thin smile. The wet “animal” organs on his table look fresh; it is unclear what type of creature has such brains.
20. One stall is unmanned. On the counter, alongside various trinkets and baubles, a sign reads “Take what you need. Leave what you can.” A small elf places down a sparkling wand and walks away with a book.

### STALL CHARACTERISTICS 



1. The stall is actually a handcart or small pony and trap that moves (slowly) about the market.
2. The stall is nothing but a thick blanket laid on the floor upon which the merchant's goods are displayed.
3. Two similar stalls stand next to one another. The two merchants spend much of their time shouting insults at each other and trying to steal their rival's customers.
4. Two large (and lazy) hounds lounge under this stall's table. They give each customer an exploratory sniff.
5. This stall is a grand tent with the sides rolled up to reveal the goods stacked high within. A worker stands outside, loudly extolling the virtues of its goods.
6. An obviously depressed merchant sits—with head in hands—behind this virtually ignored stall. Trade is not going well.
7. This stall is very popular; a large crowd has gathered in front of it and customers are jockeying for position. The stall's owner cannot keep up with demand.
8. The owner of this stall is sycophantic in the extreme and calls out to anyone passing by who looks like they might have money to spend.
9. Groaning with goods, this stall's trestle tables seem dangerously overfilled.
10. This stall comprises a wagon piled high with goods. The owner does business from the back of the wagon while his horse looks on glumly. 





## THINGS TO SEE IN A MARKET 



1. A small boy quickly slips through the throng, dextrously squeezing between the shoppers and browsers. The characters may assume the boy is a cutpurse, but in reality, he is merely running an errand for his master.
2. A massively muscled man, longsword at his hip, staggers through the marketplace with a large rolled-up rug over one shoulder. Unsurprisingly, everyone gets out of the man's way. If asked why he is carrying a rug, he replies it is for a bet. This may—or may not—be the truth. Perhaps the rug bulges suspiciously and an unconscious, tied-up kidnap victim lies within.
3. An obviously wealthy woman strolls among the stalls examining the goods. Two servants—carry various packages and bags—and a mail-clad bodyguard trails after her.
4. Several beggars raise their bowls to passers-by, desperate for even the smallest gift.
5. A bard—employed by a nearby smallholder who has recently taken delivery of a consignment of rare spices— strolls through the throng loudly singing the praises of Master Arman and his amazing spices. If stopped—or if the characters show any interest in his song—he eagerly directs them to Master Arman's stall.
6. A crowd of people have gathered around a small, nondescript stall. The owner is apparently trying to offload a consignment of damaged cloth and is selling it at knock-down prices. He could be genuinely trying to get rid of his damaged stock, or he could be a distraction for several pickpockets slipping unseen through the throng.
7. A pair of women stand conspiratorially gossiping in the shade of a tent. They stop suddenly if approached.
8. A peddler—selling vegetables from a hand cart—trundles by the party calling out his prices. He stumbles and falls, tipping over his cart. Almost instantly beggars and urchins appear and start grabbing up his produce as he desperately tries to both shovel it back into his cart and fight off the swarm of scavengers.
9. A man argues with a store holder, loudly accusing him of selling crap. He waves an axe in the air while doing so. Characters taking any interest in the argument notice the axe head wobbles on its haft as it is waved about.
10. A near-feral dog sniffs its way through the crowd searching for dropped tidbits. He follows anyone feeding him.
11. A cat lounges on the awning above a stall, keeping a wary eye on all who pass.
12. Two young urchins caper through the crowd laughing and joking with each other. Their youthful exuberance annoys a trader who suspects they are clearly up to no good and he shouts at them to "be off”.
13. Two guardsmen patrol the marketplace, keeping an eye out for arguments and cutpurses. They appear bored, though, and are easily distracted.
14. A dishevelled man—clearly unwell, his tunic stained with vomit—staggers through the crowd (which parts before him). Eventually, he slumps against a wall, muttering to himself. (The man is not ill; he is merely suffering with an epic hangover.)
15. Two traders argue—and look like they may come to blows; it seems they both paid for the same pitch, and neither is inclined to give up his claim.
16. A sudden heavy squall sends everyone running for cover. Stalls with awnings or those within tents are suddenly very popular, and the merchants therein mercilessly press their temporary advantage.
17. One of the characters—perhaps distracted by the market's sights and sounds—stands in a large pile of horse manure. Unless he fastidiously cleans his shoe, the smell follows him for the rest of the day.
18. The smell of freshly cooked meat wafts enticingly over the crowd. Nearby, a merchant selling a hog roast is doing a roaring trade.
19. A carter tries to force his way through the throng, but almost no one seems inclined to get out of his cart's way. The man is clearly getting more and more frustrated and shouts loudly at anyone wandering in front of his cart.
20. Three finely dress old ladies browse amongst the stalls while chatting loudly. Each is attended by a servant, but perceptive characters may spot four ruffians intently watching the group. 





## MERCHANTS WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Hildi Borgusdotter, Blacksmith: Hildi comes from a long, proud tradition of blacksmithing, and often exclaims her forge has been the family's business for generations. Hildi's a tad on the pricy side, and she has little patience for hagglers, quickly taking offence at any slight against her family's masterpieces.
2. Emil Jarvi, Alchemist: A lean young man with short hair and a severe gaze, Emil sells a variety of tonics, herbs, poultices and various alchemical concoctions. Though he begrudgingly keeps a supply of the more in-demand potions, he is quick to decry the “over-dependence on magic that is currently afflicting our society,” and that magic is “too fickle a force to trust with your life.”
3. Sendra Bisset, Haberdasher: While Sendra is well into middle age, no one who looks at her would guess it, as she takes great pains to preserve her beauty and youthful good looks. Though her stall specialises in hats of all kinds, including a variety of magical headgear, an odd assortment of gloves, scarves, purses and other accessories can also be found here. Those looking for plain and functional clothes should look elsewhere: her motto is “if it isn't beautiful, it's not worth owning.”
4. Marcis Vincelas, Jeweller: This handsome young man has long, dark hair, and speaks with a thick, foreign accent. Although he is not the stall's owner, he is knowledgeable about jewellery and suchlike, and his incorrigible flirting makes him an excellent salesman, though he drops the act for rich adventurers shopping for magic jewellery.
5. Johin Nigul, Curio Merchant: This bald, slightly rotund merchant carefully watches every customer. Irritable and suspicious, he grumbles and complains about “window shoppers,” and threatens those who touch his wares with the phrase “you break it, you buy it!” Still, his selection of magic items is impressive, and for repeat customers, he can special-order things he doesn't stock.
6. Kian Golshan, Weapon and Armour Merchant: This merchant sports a well-oiled goatee, slick hair and bright, flamboyant clothing. Far from a blacksmith himself, he assures customers he only carries the best merchandise money can buy. He is very fond of arranging little demonstrations which supposedly show off his sharp blades or durable armours, but canny buyers can tell this is all showmanship, and the demonstrations are little more than sleight of hand.
7. Sabine Gagnier, Baker: This plump blonde woman loves nothing more than watching a customer enjoy one of her fresh-cooked confections. Her sunny disposition seems to know no bounds, and she is quick to recommend the perfect pastry to solve any problem or at least make one feel a bit better while they solve it. She offers several “magic potion”-infused pastries, which have effects similar to potions but are, in her words, “far more delicious.”
8. Evron Teivel, Exotic Animal Merchant: This kind-faced man personally trains and works with each animal he sells, and has been known to refuse sales to buyers he thinks can't provide a good home for the animal. If an animal takes a particular liking to a prospective buyer, Evron sometimes offers a substantial discount, especially for less popular animals.
9. Anila Kleid, Potion and Scroll Merchant: This elderly merchant recently retired from teaching young wizards at a local arcane university. She brews fresh potions and sells scrolls from the large collection she accumulated over the years in order to supplement her savings. Buyers beware, each purchase comes with a lecture or story of some kind, whether the customer wants it or not.
10. Ozan Balik, Pawn Merchant: This hawkish, gaunt man has very sparse grey hair and peers at customers over half-moon glasses. He has a wide assortment of items for sale but is also more than happy to buy or pawn interesting objects. A consummate haggler, he routinely overcharges for his sales and underpays for his purchases, and always has a dozen reasons why he can't give a better price. 





## DEALS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE 



1. This spellbook has an amazingly low price tag considering the numerous powerful spells contained within. Unfortunately, it was stolen, and its previous owner, a powerful wizard, is actively searching for it.
2. This deal is a gold mine—literally! The seller offers the deed to an abandoned gold mine said to still be brimming with gold. While this is true, it's also brimming with ghosts.
3. There's a reason this powerful magic weapon is so cheap: the magic affecting it is temporary, and will only last a few hours.
4. This trained animal, whether a bird, dog, horse or something more exotic, is well trained. Unfortunately, what it's trained to do is escape at the first opportunity and return to the seller.
5. No one wants to pay for spell components, and it's tempting to try to cut corners when buying them. This merchant offers them at a great price, but unfortunately, they're old and stale, reducing the efficacy of spells cast using them.
6. This suit of armour is so inexpensive because it serves as a magic beacon for the seller's friends, a group of bandits who use it to ambush and rob victims. Worse, a command word causes the armour to lock up, effectively paralysing the wearer.
7. When visiting a new city, having to pay to exchange money for the local currency can be frustrating. Luckily, a kindly monk sitting outside the moneychangers offers to make the exchange for free. Sadly, it's a scam, and he exchanges good coins for counterfeit.
8. The reason this powerful magic weapon is so cheap is that it's haunted by the spirits of those slain by it. These spirits haunt the dreams of the weapon's owner.
9. Owning a toll bridge is a great way to make money, and luckily, someone is willing to offer up a deed for one. Unfortunately, the bridge is out in the middle of nowhere and now sees almost no traffic. These facts do not come up in negotiations.
10. Need a new purse after being pick-pocketed? This vendor sells them on the cheap, but each one is enchanted to magically teleport a few coins at a time back to his own coffers.
11. Not all spellbooks are created equal, and while this one contains a great selection of rare and powerful spells, it also contains a number of minor transcription errors that make each enchantment prone to dangerous mishaps.
12. This galleon is available to buy at a very low price, but it's docked outside the harbour. The seller is happy to take prospective buyers out to it, but shortly after they set sail, the unfortunate new owners are press-ganged as galley slaves by pirates lurking in a hidden hold.
13. This powerful magic weapon is actually the weapon used in a very high-profile recent murder. While it is incredibly cheap to purchase, its new owner may very well be mistaken for the murderer.
14. It's not too hard to find a mage offering spellcasting services for 75% of the normal rates. Unfortunately, she's still learning her trade, and there's a 25% chance of a magical mishap, instead of the spell's intended effect.
15. For only a handful of gold, the map to a buried treasure worth thousands of gold seems like a great deal. Unfortunately, the seller has already sold about 300 copies of the map, and it's unlikely the treasure's still there (if it ever was).
16. The price for the deed to this remote manor house is very generous, and the seller even has a painting featuring it to show off. Sadly, the painting is from before it became a dilapidated, haunted wreck.
17. This potion, sold by an evil death-worshipping cultist, is half the normal price but infused with a deadly plague.
18. This magic weapon may cost a little more than one might expect, but it was once wielded by a legendary hero. Or, at least, so the seller claims.
19. A kindly innkeeper, a few miles out of town, offers free room and board for the night, supposedly so the characters don't have to push to reach town by nightfall, but really it's so she can murder them as they sleep and eat them.
20. Who can say no to a free amulet delivered by a secret admirer? Unfortunately, the admirer works for an enemy of the characters, and the amulet allows them to listen to every word spoken in its vicinity. 





## MARKET WHISPERS & RUMOURS 



1. Old Jerad's pies are the sweetest and tastiest in the whole market. They are so good, they must have magic in them!
2. A new fortuneteller has just set up shop in the market. No one knows anything about her, but apparently, her predictions are uncannily accurate.
3. The sewers running near the market are old and prone to blockage (and flood) after heavy rains. When that happens, the marketplace is awash with dirty water and sewerage. It's very bad for business—the mayor should do something about it.
4. A recent rash of pickpocketing has annoyed customers and merchants alike. A thief was almost beaten to death yesterday, in the market.
5. The local lord is reviewing the cost of hiring plots in the marketplace. Everyone expects him to raise prices and the stallholders will inevitably pass this additional cost onto their customers.
6. Herac the merchant is boasting of a recent delivery of fine, rare silks. He's planning to personally invite the town's great and good to a showing of his wares, but he has some lesser silks suitable for “ordinary” people.
7. Erinhol Gerst sells wine and ale by the pitcher or cup from his handcart. He wanders the market selling to thirsty shoppers and is an excellent source of rumours. He hears much and charges to pass on his knowledge.
8. Normally, the market is a relatively clean place—the local lord mandates merchants remove their own rubbish. However, more and more people are reporting encounters with large and aggressive rats scavenging among the stalls. It's putting off some visitors.
9. Watch out for Eron Erkle. He is a grocer by trade, but his scales are weighted in his favour and you won't get your money's worth.
10. Berstal the Fabulous is a charlatan. He pretends to be an apothecary, but his remedies never work—in fact, they often make his patient sicker!
11. There was a murder—really a robbery gone wrong—in the market the other day. A mugger picked the wrong victim and got electrocuted to death by a magic spell!
12. Erinhol Gerst (see #7) is really a member of the thieves' guild. He uses his business to spy on potential marks— normally gullible adventuring types!
13. He denies it, of course, but Brastel Enanon's is often accused of selling stolen goods. He denies all charges, and nothing has even been proven but if you buy something from him you might be accosted by someone claiming to have once owned your newest possession.
14. Brestia Nimblefingers is a skilled tattooist much in demand in the local area. Small even for a halfling, she does exquisite work. Word is that she's been trying to imbue her tattoos with magic for years now but never gets the process quite right.
15. If you've got a pet (or an animal companion or familiar) you'd do well to keep it close in the market; several visitors have complained their animals have gone missing while they shopped.
16. Two rival clothiers are doing their best to put each other out of business. Both send their apprentices to sabotage the other's stall and steal their customers. Sometimes, a brawl ensues. The Watch breaks things up, but their patience is rapidly fading.
17. Someone is using false coins in the market. They appear to be silver or gold but are really painted bronze. Several merchants have lost sizeable sums and—even worse—the coins have entered general circulation.
18. A hulking half-orc—a monk named Narfu—has set up a stall of sorts. Really, it's more of entertainment as he performs amazing acrobatic tricks. He bets the audience no one is more skilled than he, and thus far, he's been proven right.
19. The local thieves use the marketplace to stalk rich marks. Those with much coin to spend should keep their purses close and their eyes open.
20. One of the stall keepers is really a vindictive evil wizard with a vendetta against the local lord. He sells seemingly mundane items laced with subtle curses designed to make the owner more angry and irritable. Several fights have broken out recently, but the wizard's identity—if indeed he exists—remains a mystery. The rumours above are designed to be relatively generic so they fit into almost any town or city. You should modify them as required to fit the flavour of your campaign. Finally—of course—it is up to you if the rumours above are true or false. 





# CREEPY GRAVEYARD 







## GRAVEYARD SIGHTS 



1. A lone gravestone—much weather-worn and overgrown by weeds—stands off alone to one side.
2. A stand of dense trees creates an area of deep shade. The trees' roots are so dense no graves can be dug beneath their boughs.
3. A large oak tree stands majestically among the graves. Coloured ribbons and streamers hang from its lower branches and move gently in the wind.
4. An open grave—freshly dug—awaits its occupant.
5. Several spades rammed into a pile of freshly dug earth stand next to an open grave.
6. Three graves lie close to one another. A low iron wrought fence pierced by a single gate surrounds the trio. Within the fence's perimeter, the grass is neat and well-tended.
7. A small shrine decorated with the carved decorations of all the local deitys' sigils stands near the graveyard's main entrance.
8. Obscured by a thick hawthorn hedge, a shrine dedicated to the god of death stands at the centre of the graveyard. The shrine is little used—except by those recent bereaved. Three grim-faced clerics maintain the shrine, conduct services and oversee the graveyard.
9. A long, low mound covered in wildflowers dominates one side of the graveyard. Here are buried the victims of some long-ago disaster—perhaps a plague, war or large fire that ripped through the town.
10. Low hedges heavy with blooms divide the graveyard into sections.
11. Four men carry a coffin through the graveyard. A weeping man helped along by a grim-faced priest follows in their wake.
12. A large crow—its black feathers glimmering in the light— perches atop a gravestone and caws loudly when anyone approaches.
13. A cluster of people stands around a grave, arguing loudly and gesticulating wildly.
14. A lone figure stands in the gloom beneath a stand of trees. He seems to be watching the graveyard intently, but if approached, he disappears into the shadows.
15. The wind moans among the headstones.
16. Wind chimes hang from the branches of the trees scattered about the graveyard. When the wind blows, they create a discordant clamour. The locals believe this keeps the ghosts of the dead in their graves.
17. A stonemason is on his knees in front of a grave, carving something onto a headstone. He could be making a correction to a carving, finishing a decorative carving or adding graffiti to the grave of a hated rival.
18. Dark clouds hang over the graveyard, casting the whole area into dismal gloom.
19. Several of the gravestones are topped with half-melted candles. Their wax has dripped down and dried on the face of the stone. The dried red wax looks like old blood.
20. Suddenly the birds pecking among the graves or perching in the surrounding trees all fall silent. Moments later—in the sudden quiet—they take flight. 

## STRANGE SOUNDS 



1. A rustle in the bushes off to one side hints at something small scurrying about.
2. The wind plucks at the party's cloaks, as it moans through the graveyard.
3. Faint sobbing coming from behind a gravestone reaches the party's ears.
4. A tree's bare branches clack together as faint wind gusts through the graveyard.
5. A faint, indeterminate whispering assails the party's ears.
6. A large black crow perched on a gravestone far from the path caws loudly before taking to the air. It circles the party twice before flying away.
7. Snatches of conversation reach the party's ears. The words “dead”, “burial”, and “rise” are discernible, but there is no one nearby.
8. Somewhere unseen behind the party, a dog starts howling. The howling continues for a minute or two before abruptly stopping.
9. The grunts of exertion and sounds of picks and shovels cutting into the earth show three gravediggers are hard at work.
10. Loud wailing echoes through the graveyard. Investigation reveals a mourner kneeling before a freshly filled grave, seemingly inconsolable with grief. 

## STRANGE SENSATIONS 



1. The temperature suddenly drops to near freezing in the area immediately around the party. After a few moments, it quickly returns to normal.
2. One of the characters has the growing feeling someone or something unseen is watching their progress.
3. One of the characters feels strangely dizzy and almost collapses. After a five-minute rest, the feeling passes.
4. Shadows cluster particularly thickly about several old grave markers. To a fevered imagination, it looks like the shadows are rhythmically pulsating. 





## THINGS TO FIND IN AN OPEN GRAVE 



1. A spade stands at a crazy angle at the bottom of the graveyard. A soft cloth hat hangs from its handle, but of the gravedigger, there is no sign. A close inspection of the handle reveals a small smudge of blood.
2. A bunch of wildflowers fashioned into a crude wreath lies in the mud at the bottom of the grave.
3. Muddy water has seeped into the grave, turning the bottom into a dank, cloying sludge. A trapped rat swims in the water, but try as it might it can't climb up the slippery muddy sides of the grave to escape.
4. Heaped earth stands next to the open grave. Nearby lies a headstone ready to be erected once the grave is filled.
5. An unattended coffin of stout pine lies in the grave. No one is filling in the grave—in fact, no one seems to be anywhere near the grave.
6. At first glance, this grave seems normal and unremarkable. However, a perceptive character notices the faint outline of a long bulky object obscured by the earth. Investigations reveal it is another coffin. It is rotten and has obviously been buried for years.
7. At first glance, this grave seems normal and unremarkable. However, a perceptive character notices an amulet half-buried in the mud. Characters retrieving the amulet discover it bears the symbol of a particularly reviled evil deity.
8. Someone has sprinkled salt over the bottom of the grave and on the mound of earth beside it.
9. The open grave stands near an old tree. The tree's roots break through the grave's walls and floor in several places. Imaginative souls could imagine the roots look like a huge grasping hand ready to receive the coffin.
10. As #5 but the coffin lid is splintered and broken as if from several heavy blows with an axe. The desecrated coffin itself is empty. 

## GRAVESTONE INSCRIPTIONS 



1. Vermor Hode: Most beloved husband, father and grandfather.
2. Raich Ironblade: She died as she lived, a hero.
3. Yoskel Wulf: His bark was worse than his bite.
4. Celindra Wintervale: In her too-short time here, she taught us how to truly love.
5. Luthian Cooper: He led his brother in birth and in life.
6. Codren Cooper: His Brother's Keeper.
7. Irano Stork: O Dragonslayer! In death, you were victorious!
8. Thorell Rockbeard: Though far from his own people, no dwarf was better loved.
9. Ranbel Crackfang: He looked like a monster, but was a better man than most.
10. Shadvar Hench: She will never truly die while those she saved draw breath.
11. Sir Ahelineih Wildleaf: [Written in Elven] May you sustain the earth in death as you did in life.

13. [Unreadable] Evinmoor: [unreadable] No more will you [unreadable] the people of [unreadable].
14. Oldol Blackfire: He overcame his devils.
15. Leeness Thistleright: Death is just a dream, from which we all must wake.
16. Lady Rilanca Highbarrow: Your soul calls out for vengeance; may its cries not go unheeded.
17. Gryphon [unreadable]: Render unto the Reaper what is due her.
18. Askal Tems: The Goblins may have taken his body, but they cannot touch his soul.
19. Zanvin Tanybar Fezzstersticks: Are you truly gone from this world, or just gone from this place?
20. Samtin Howellson: Even alchemy has its limits. 





## STRANGE MAUSOLEUMS 



1. This mausoleum is made of an unusual blood-red stone. The local groundskeeper swears that every time there's a storm, the lightning only ever strikes the mausoleum, although the structure bears no sign of any damage.
2. A ghostly figure can sometimes be seen pacing restlessly outside this mausoleum at night. In truth, the ghost is an illusory image of the mausoleum's occupant, which was once always present, but has become unreliable over the centuries.
3. Belonging to an eccentric nobleman, this ornate mausoleum holds the remains of his most prized hounds. The outside is decorated with gargoyles and bas-reliefs shaped like dogs.
4. Only three-foot-high, but completely to scale, this mausoleum features tiny figures engraved on its sides, needle-like spires and a plaque too small to read. Characters opening the miniature door discover the building is hollow and contains only an urn.
5. The interior of this mausoleum features a trapdoor, which opens over a horrific pit filled with dozens of corpses heaped haphazardly atop one another.
6. This grand mausoleum takes the shape of a tower, unlike the short, squat structures beside it. A blue/green light shines from its zenith on most nights but is dark on the last night of each month.
7. The interior of this mausoleum is a single, large room. Rather than sarcophagi or biers, the mausoleum's inhabitants sit in elegant chairs around an oak table, which is set for a tea party.
8. Made entirely of smoked glass, one can just faintly make out the biers within this sealed mausoleum. Occasionally, locals report seeing a hazy figure moving around inside or hearing the sound of something tapping on the glass.
9. Known locally as the Banshee's Tomb, a strange singing sometimes emanates from this mausoleum. By day, locals insist it's just wind whistling through cracks in the building, but at night, they're less confident.
10. This massive mausoleum is carved to resemble a sleeping dragon. The entrance is in the dragon's mouth, and the long, narrow corridor serving as its neck leads to the main chamber.
11. There are no rumours that this mausoleum houses the undead: the four zombies standing guard outside it night and day are plain to see. Devoted servants of the demanding lord interred within, they willingly serve him even in death.
12. A cleverly disguised elevator descending into catacombs below, this plain-looking mausoleum is rather sparse inside and out. Its lone sarcophagus is empty, other than a hidden lever that operates the elevator.
13. Something about this mausoleum attracts the undead. Any mindless or semi-intelligent undead creatures coming near, even those controlled by magic, suddenly stop what they are doing and head straight for it, standing outside its door patiently.
14. This grim mausoleum is constructed entirely of bones, which have been painstakingly mortared together like bricks to form a solid structure.
15. Standing in a swampy hollow, usually only the roof of this mausoleum is visible above the muck. By speaking a magic word known only to the family owning the crypt, it can be made to rise, allowing entrance.
16. The entrance to this mausoleum is bricked up. The bricks are clearly a much later addition and seem to have been laid with haste, more than care.
17. The door to this mausoleum appears to be locked from the inside, and the door features both a knocker and a small viewing slit that can be opened only from within.
18. This mausoleum is only present in the light of a full moon. At all other times, the plot it occupies is simply a vacant patch of grass.
19. This mausoleum glistens in the moonlight, and close inspection reveals it is because a clear, ectoplasmic slime is seeping from its walls.
20. Barely recognisable as a mausoleum, this 12-foot-tall obsidian obelisk features a door on one side, and just enough space on the interior for its occupant to stand for all eternity. 





## GRAVEYARD RUMOURS 



1. Recent heavy rain, or perhaps a minor tremor, recently unearthed a massive, unmarked grave in an unused corner of the graveyard. No one knows exactly who is buried there, or why, and officials are scrambling to get the bodies sorted and properly buried.
2. One or more famous people are buried in the graveyard, and visitors come from miles around to view the grave; some even leave offerings on it.
3. For the last few weeks, every few nights, a new tombstone is broken, split clean in two, as though it had been cut. So far, there are no leads on who the vandals are or how they're accomplishing this feat.
4. Rumour has it, that a particularly notorious thief buried his last big score in the graveyard just a few nights before he was arrested and, eventually, hung for his crimes. Supposedly, he never revealed the treasure's location, and it's still buried somewhere.
5. An eccentric noble is hurriedly building a massive mausoleum on the grounds. It's far larger and more ostentatious than anything else in the graveyard and very much out of character for her. Even more puzzling, she is still in relatively good health, so why is she in such a rush for it to be completed?
6. One local comes to the graveyard often and spends hours there in the afternoon and evening, just sitting under a tree. He has no loved ones buried here, so why does he do this nearly every day?
7. The graveyard used to be a popular spot for young lovers to have midnight rendezvous until the terrible morning when just such a pair was found gruesomely murdered. More troubling, the killer was never caught.
8. They say the groundskeeper's been here as long as anyone can remember. In fact, some say she died years ago but has kept doing the job all the same.
9. Supposedly, a local coven of sorcerers, witches and other practitioners of black magic gather in the graveyard one night each month to perform strange and terrible rituals.
10. They say an infamous ladies' man is buried somewhere in the graveyard. If you visit his grave and ask just right, his blessing can make the object of your desires fall in love with you.
11. A battle was fought not far from the graveyard a long time ago, and soldiers from both sides fought over the cemetery. According to local legend, on the battle's anniversary, the soldiers' spirits rise up and fight again.
12. In the olden times, a secret tunnel was dug under the graveyard to allow supplies to be smuggled into town during a siege. Supposedly, one of the graves is fake and actually an entrance to this long-abandoned tunnel.
13. The graveyard was cursed by a necromancer who was executed here long ago. Anyone buried within who goes unmourned for a year and a day rises as an undead.
14. All coffins and caskets made in town are lined with lead. The locals say it's to keep wolves from getting inside, but there aren't any wolves for miles around.
15. They say the groundskeeper secretly steals all the bodies of those buried in the graveyard and that the coffins buried in the graveyard contain nothing but cheap sackcloth dolls. What he does with the real bodies is anyone's guess.
16. For some reason, any flowers left on a certain grave wither and decay completely overnight until they are nothing but blackened husks by the next morning.
17. Strange lights can be seen in the graveyard at night, but only on foggy nights. Sometimes strange noises can be heard as well.
18. Children tell tales of a murderer so terrible that the local lord decreed that rather than execute her, she would be transformed into a ghoul and locked away in a grave, in this very graveyard, to be imprisoned for a thousand years in solitude.
19. Stories are told of a local bandit who only had one hand buried in the graveyard. They say his other hand still lives, and it stalks the night, strangling those foolish enough to enter the graveyard.
20. The groundskeeper has a talent for séances and can channel the spirit of anyone interred in the graveyard for a small price. 





## MOURNERS WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Irma Varini (N old female human): Distraught after her husband's death Irma comes to the graveyard daily to talk with her dead partner. She can often be seen sitting by his grave, and sometimes she stays for hours. Her husband was obsessed with appearances, and so she pays a groundskeeper to ensure the grave is welltended. It stands in marked contrast to other neglected graves nearby.
2. Kuno Salii (NE young male human): Bored and lost after the death of his parents, Kuno wanders the graveyard without any real goal or purpose…except mischief. This thin, pale-faced boy still wears the smart, slightly too big clothes he wore to his parents' funeral. Although he now lives with his uncle, he is not above trying to get some gold out of kind-hearted, gullible adventurers.
3. Hogar (NG male half-orc fighter 3): Hogar is angry. He is angry at the disease that took his beloved. He is angry at the clerics who failed to cure her. He is angry at anyone who asks him if he is okay. In short, he is angry, and he is looking to take it out on someone. In a dishevelled state and clutching a wine flask, he sits near his lover's grave, drinking heavily and muttering to himself. He does not take kindly to distractions or interruptions.
4. Aenor Hallin (N female human cleric 1): Aenor is a professional mourner paid to offer daily prayers at a deceased's grave. She is skilled at fake crying and looks the part—clad in sombre black robes and wearing a veil. Always on the lookout for more business, she approaches anyone who appears wealthy hanging around the graveyard after finishing her most recent prayer. She is softly spoken and respectful but doesn't have a lot of time for the living (unless she is being paid).
5. Onni (dog): With her master dead and buried in the pauper section of the graveyard, Onni has become a graveyard fixture. Her shaggy coat has become a familiar sight about the graveyard; she can often be seen sitting mournfully near her master's final resting place—a pauper mass grave. A sort of minor celebrity, Onni has become beloved by the groundkeepers who have even built her a small, ramshackle kennel under a tree in sight of her master's grave.
6. Herleva Taetel (NE female middle-aged human wizard 3): Herleva wanders among the graves and tombs searching for long-lost relatives who are said to be buried here…or at least that's what she tells anyone who asks. In reality, she is searching for the resting place of a minor mageling—Lanzo Njars—who died a century ago. Recently, she came across an old diary recounting the mage's burial that suggested he was buried with certain objects of power she craves.
7. Ivo Ubi (LG venerable male human paladin 2): Now old and wizened, Ivo comes to the graveyard to pray at the graves of those of the faith he once knew. He feels cursed to have lived so long—all his friends and comrades are long dead—but is conflicted. Does his long life yet have a purpose? Why is his lord not yet ready to call him to his side? Half-blind and partially deaf, Ivo is well known by the graveyard's caretakers—who let him wander as he will among the tombstones.
8. Eohric (N male human bard 2): Eohric isn't a very good singer and wanders among the gravestones while trying to compose an elegy for his beloved pet dog, Inga, whom he had buried in his family plot. Eohric isn't exactly gifted in the brains department and talks incessantly of his lost love. Only exhaustive questioning reveals Inga was a dog.
9. Cynric Welwyn (NE male human): Brawny and strong, Cynric is digging his own dead sister's grave. Muttering while he works, he scowls at all who come near and isn't afraid to tell anyone to mind their own business. Cynric's sister was recently taken by the plague, and he nursed her through her final days. A twist of fate—or perhaps a dark, cosmic joke—has rendered him immune to the plague's effects but still left him a carrier meaning he could potentially infect anyone who spends too much time in his presence.
10. Liuva (CN female half-elf): Yet young, Liuva has watched her human mother age and die. Impetuous, headstrong and now utterly shattered by her mother's death Liuva sobs by her mother's grave most days. Bitter, she rails against the unfairness of “her” situation and is looking for answers. Recently, one of the groundsmen—a member of a death cult—has started sounding her out about joining the cult. Liuva is in danger of falling under his sway... 











## GRAVEYARD HAUNTINGS 



1. An item disappears from a character's gear as faint cackling echoes from far away. When looked for, the item is barely visible among another character's gear, as if the second character had hastily stowed it.
2. The holy symbol on a gravestone cracks violently, and dozens of worms pour forth when it is visible only in the corner of the eye. The grave is marked “Anilda Ravenheart”. Locals recall this young half-orc woman had a crisis of faith as a result of a sudden illness that eventually killed her.
3. A veiled woman cries out, begging to know where her family's graves are, as she runs between markers and sinks to the ground at a nearby intersection. When approached, her veil blows away to reveal a faceless silhouette that asks, “Where is my grave?” before she disintegrates into dust and is blown away by a sudden gust of wind.
4. An unconsecrated grave in a lonesome spot is overgrown and surrounded by tall weeds. When examined, the plants writhe despite not a breath of wind, and the characters feel tangles of plants grasping at them. A ropey weed swiftly twines up from the ground around a character's neck, forming a limp noose. The plants then vanish. The grave is marked “Noxanna Gorholm”; records show the woman therein was hanged for brigandry.
5. A mound of uprooted lilies covers a fresh grave. The mound crumples suddenly as if an unseen human child or halfling knelt on it. A high-pitched voice chants singsong nonsense words while the mound rapidly moulders away to nothing. The gravestone reads “Margrimm Suresteel”. Local stories say he was a generous dwarven trader who was thrown from his horse after desecrating a fairy ring.
6. A luminous armoured halfling patrols a distant path. Anyone speaking to him or looking directly at him is momentarily wrapped in supernatural silence. The figure gapes and turns as if to run. It then vanishes while the speaker feels the air briefly grow thin.
7. An open grave with a blank marker seems to be bottomless. Upon examination, a howling wind sucks in dust and leaves from nearby plants while shrieks of anguish and pain fill the air for a moment before the vision passes. The grave is only six-foot deep and shows no sign of disturbance.
8. A small tarnished bell at the foot of an old grave rings as if yanked strongly from below, but the rope isn't connected to anything. The grave is marked “Lorantus Vornmark”. Investigations reveal he was an elderly human who died quietly in his sleep. If exhumed, the skeletal remains are curled in the foot of the coffin, surrounded by scratch marks. If the characters choose to lay a haunt to rest, the required method should generally relate to the haunt's backstory and probably not involve mere combat. Success may grant boons from the dead unfortunate's relatives or friends. At the least, the folk watching over the graveyard will likely be grateful to the characters for putting an unquiet spirit to rest. 





# CRYPTS & CATACOMBS 




## CRYPT & CATACOMB DRESSING 



1. Dust and grime lie thick upon the crypt's paved floor. Dusty cobwebs hang from the ceiling and gently undulate in some subtle, unseen (and barely felt) breeze.
2. Some of the crypt's paves have shifted and moved, creating difficult terrain. The skeletal remains of a dog or cat are curled up on a sarcophagus.
3. Small holes in a wall at floor level show where rats have tunnelled their way into the crypt. Signs of their presence—tiny tracks, droppings and so on—abound.
4. A perceptive character notices scratches on the floor around several sarcophagi, suggesting they have been moved at some point. Hidden niches could lie below the sarcophagi, or the scratches could merely have been caused by other adventurers searching for treasure.
5. Strange patterns in the dust on the floor could be indicative of an occasional breeze entering the crypt from some slight crevice. Alternatively, they could provide a clue as to the presence of an undead guardian (or resident).
6. The heavy lids of several of the sarcophagi are not on properly. Was something trying to get out, or was someone trying to get in?
7. The corner of a sarcophagus has crumbled away, providing a narrow, shadowed view of what lies within. Perceptive characters realise the crumbled corner is the result of damage. Perhaps the sarcophagus was dropped as it was lifted into place, or perhaps a thief smashed their way in.
8. Graffiti records the initials of several folk who have visited the place over the years. Many of the inscriptions are dated, giving a clue to the crypt's age.
9. Water oozes through cracks in one wall, creating an area of glistening stonework. A shallow puddle of grey water lies at the wall's base.
10. The corner of a wooden coffin has partially rotted away— water drips from the ceiling directly above the burial niche. Pieces of bone, scraps of fabric and the like have tumbled from the coffin onto the floor.
11. A previous explorer, mourner or worker was trapped in the tomb and died alone in the dark. Their mouldering corpse slumps against the crypt's outer door and clatters to the floor when the door is opened.
12. Spiders infest the crypt; curtains of their dusty webs drape from the ceilings and statues and over some of the sarcophagi. The many tiny spiders dwelling in the crypt are not a threat to explorers, but characters burning the webs away may alert any nearby undead or sentient guardians.

## CRYPT & CATACOMB FEATURES 



1. The crypt's arched ceiling features many small one-footsquare tiles. Each is brightly coloured and depicts stylised scenes of the world.
2. Each of this crypt's sarcophagi stands upon one-foothigh stone plinths. The name of the interred is carved onto each plinth's riser.
3. The crypt has a wooden floor and was built over a natural cave. If the crypt is particularly old, the wood could be brittle and rotten. Incautious adventurers could step through the floor and plummet into the pit.
4. As #3 above but deep heaps of bones fill the pit. These break the adventurers' fall to some extent, but some could animate to attack those falling into their midst. The shades and haunts of the deceased could also linger in the mass grave.
5. Deep niches carved into the crypt's walls hold stacked arrays of bones. The bones are wired and glued together and form a macabre display; some such sculptures are shaped in the sigil of the god of death; disturbing them would be blasphemy.
6. A small shrine pierces one wall. A low altar, covered in mouldering offerings, burnt-down candles and the like, fills much of the niche. Faded paintings of an idealised afterlife adorn the niche's walls.
7. The crypt is virtually air-tight. Thus, when the characters first open its door the crypt the air is musty and foulsmelling. It takes an hour or so, once the crypt is opened, for the smell to dissipate.
8. A great chandelier crafted from bones held together with cunningly threaded wires hangs from the ceiling of each room. A hanging chain can be used to lower and raise each chandelier, but doing so makes a loud noise— which may alert any lurking undead to the presence of intruders (and their next meal).
9. Each chamber has an ornate archway leading into it, and each archway has prayers carved into its face. The prayers speak of death and eternal rest. Several inscriptions tell of the curses that will befall those disturbing the crypt.
10. Graven images of the god of death and his servants adorn many of the walls in a macabre display of the afterworld. In many of the images, the dead are shown kneeling for judgement before the god.
11. Wrought iron torch sconces, shaped like skeletal arms emerging from the walls, are set through the crypt. Several hold partially burnt torches. Soot stains the wall behind and ceiling above the sconces.
12. Rusty black iron gates protect each burial chamber from casual invasion. The gates squeal loudly when opened. Several are stuck shut, but none are locked.
13. The ceilings in the crypt are vaulted, and sound carries oddly through the chambers. Echoes are weird and seem to continue for longer than they should.
14. Once brightly coloured tiles decorate the floor. Many in the central parts of chambers and corridors are now cracked, chipped or broken. Pictures on the floor tiles include stylised animals, coats of arms and the like.
15. Hideously macabre statues of oversized skeletal warriors stand watch over each chamber and corridor junction. The skeletons stand on plinths in small niches and have the aspect of guardians.
16. The crypt is either old or badly built. The stones comprising its ceiling sometimes groan as they shift slightly under the pressure of the surrounding earth, stone or sand. Dust, grit and gravel lie thickly, in places.
17. The crypt's ceiling is particularly low—deliberately so to give those entering the place a sense of claustrophobia. Some of the archways are so low, human-sized explorers must crawl through them.
18. The crypt's ceilings are double the normal height. Short sets of stairs made of bones lead up to each burial niche. Some chambers feature two levels of burial niches.
19. A subterranean river has broken through into the crypt. Dark, chill water fills the crypt to a depth of four feet. When it rains above, the crypt quickly fills with water.
20. The crypt was built in this location because here the barriers between the Material and Shadow planes are particularly weak. Weak negative energy seeps into the crypt. This is not enough to animate the dead resting within, but now and then, a skeleton quivers or judders. Shadows also gather thickly in the crypt; mundane light sources and magical lights lower than 3rd-level only throw light half as far as normal. 





## THE INTERRED 



1. AAKE VILJA N male human ghost Detecting Aake's Presence: A faint, confused muttering reaches the characters' ears before Aake materialises. The transparent figure of a middle-aged man wearing homespun peasant garb slowly emerges from the distant shadows. The man is muttering and rubbing his head. Aake died so unexpectedly he doesn't understand he is dead. He is desperate for companionship and news and doesn't understand if the characters draw weapons, cast spells and so on. He is a simple peasant and has no understanding of his state. He defends himself if attacked. Personality: Aake is confused and frightened. He has been alone for a long time and the solitude is driving him slowly mad. Aake is still—just—rational, however. Mannerism: Aake is given to muttering and rubbing his head with his hands. He also sometimes quietly sobs. Rest to Rest: The characters must convince Aake that he is dead and not just trapped in a tomb. They can do this by finding his remains and reading the inscription on his coffin or by coming up with some other clever method.
2. KAIJA TUNTIA LE female human ghost wizard 12 Detecting Kaija's Presence: The stench of burnt flesh and the heady, exotic smell of spell components fills the air moments before Kaija appears. This imperious, transparent woman wears scorched and rent wizard's robes covered in blood. Kaija so very nearly discovered the secret of lichdom before her untimely death at the hands of a group of powerful dogooders. Such was her lust for life, however, that she survived her death and rose in an immortal, but unsuitable, form. Personality: Kaija rages at her untimely death and greatly desires to complete her research. While she “lives” as a ghost, she cannot carry out the essential magical research she so craves and enjoys. She must understand all magic. Mannerism: Kaija has a piercing unblinking gaze and a mouth twisted into a scornful grimace. Rest to Rest: Kaija has no intention of going quietly into the endless night. Only the utter destruction of her physical remains will suffice to banish her to death's realm. Hook: Kaija wants to complete her arcane research—and transformation into a lich. To this end, she attempts to possess any wizardly types she encounters with the goal of using their body to complete her work. If she succeeds, she creates a deadly form of new undead—a ghost lich.
3. SUNI KEIHO N male human ghost Detecting Suni's Presence: A whispering reaches the characters' ears as Suni manifests. As the whispering grows louder, they can make out the words, “The door, the door. Why did it close?” The transparent figure of a thin man wearing leather armour appears out of the gloom. Grave robbing can be a tricky business—just ask Suni. The thief attempted to rob this crypt decades ago and was caught by his own stupidity; when he entered the tomb, he forgot to wedge the door open. It closed while he was inside, consigning him to a long, slow death. Now, he is surrounded by all that he sought to steal—but cannot touch any of it. Personality: Depressed and resigned to his fate, Suni has spent years berating himself for his stupid, fatal mistake. Despite his fate, he's friendly and tries to recruit the party to his tomb looting cause. Suni loves animals and tries to pet any familiars or animal companions with the party—probably with disastrous consequences for all involved. Mannerism: Suni has a disquieting way of trying to caress or fondle anything valuable in sight. He can't touch anything and this drives him into a deep depression. Rest to Rest: Suni still wants to loot the tomb. Helping him loot the graves and burying his remains with the loot enables him—wealthy at last—to pass onto his eternal rest.
4. VAPPU MIELA CE female human ghast Detecting Vappu's Presence: Vappu's terrible stench betrays her presence. She dresses in a mishmash of clothes looted from the dead and pretends to be one of the interred —lying perfectly still in her favourite coffin or sarcophagus. A horribly shrivelled woman lies in state in this open sarcophagus. She wears a strange mishmash of clothes. The stench of death and decay hangs heavily in the air. Executed for cannibalism and other terrible, depraved acts, Vappu was destined for an unmarked grave until her influential, disbelieving family intervened. With lavish bribes and a dash of blackmail they had her interred here. They had no idea she would return from the dead to haunt the crypt. Personality: Depraved and utterly without morals, scruples or conscience Vappu is a “perfect” ghast. She exists to feed. Mannerism: Vappu licks her lips lasciviously when about to “dine” and howls with joy when she tastes fresh meat. Hook: Vappu wears her family signet ring. Her family would pay much to regain it—and more to hush up the horror of her existence. 











## SARCOPHAGI DRESSING 



1. The interred is pinned to the bottom of the sarcophagus by a steel spike driven through their chest.
2. Faint scratch marks on the underside of the sarcophagus's lid suggest (horrifyingly) that its occupant was not dead when they were placed within.
3. The remains in this sarcophagus are nothing but mouldering bone and scraps of fabric. A cloud of dust shoots from the sarcophagus when it is opened.
4. This sarcophagus contains two corpses, not one. The two are piled one atop another. The uppermost body is obviously newer than the other and has a plain iron dagger shoved through its back. A rust-red stain coats the older remains and the bottom of the sarcophagus.
5. A graven prayer speaking of eternal rest and the afterlife decorates the underside of the sarcophagus's lid. The words are picked out with silver, and sparkle invitingly in the party's lights. Alternatively, or additionally, the prayer could contain mystical wards preventing a dead body from rising as an undead. Removing the silver destroys the ward—potentially triggering the deceased's revival.
6. This sarcophagus does not hold a body. Strangely, only a mouldering set of clothes lie in the sarcophagus suggesting a body once lay here.
7. Thick, springy black mould grows over the sarcophagus's lid, partly effacing any inscriptions or other decorations thereon. Perceptive characters spot twelve tiny holes—reminiscent of air holes—piercing the sarcophagus's lid. The holes are not wide enough to see what lies within.
8. This ebon sarcophagus is overly wide and heavy. Its sides and lid are two-foot thick. The lid is incredibly difficult to shift. The sarcophagus is crafted from loadstone and is magnetic. Characters wearing metal armour or carrying large metal weapons feel the sarcophagus's insistent tug first.
9. The deceased had a glass eye. It stares sightlessly from the mouldering corpse and glints in the party's light.
10. The skeletal remains of a cat or small dog—a beloved pet —lie curled up at the deceased's feet. If the deceased animates because of the party's investigations, the pet also animates.
11. A dozen rats were interred with the deceased. They flensed the corpse before turning on each other. The inside of the sarcophagus is a charnel house—a jumble of bones and dried bloodstains hints at the rats' fate.
12. The deceased lies on a sumptuous velvet pillow and mattress. The inside of the sarcophagus features now faded but once beautifully painted wooden panels depicting key—or perhaps idealised—moments from the deceased's life. 

## GRAVE GOODS 



1. The interred wears two small gold rings each worth 20 gp, on its left hand.
2. A plain silver dagger rests in a mouldering leather scabbard upon the deceased's breast. The dagger is plain and severe and remains wickedly sharp. The sun god's sigil adorns the dagger's pommel.
3. At first glance, this sarcophagus holds nothing of value. A perceptive character, however, spots a platinum earring lying amid the dust behind the interred's head. The earring is in the shape of a graceful dolphin.
4. The interred clutches a mouldering diary—or perhaps spellbook—to their chest. The book has a plain red dusty cover. Slight indentations in the cover show where its owner has clutched it tightly. Time has rendered the book illegible.
5. The deceased wears a dusty, but otherwise in good condition, fur coat. The fur is from a black bear and is deep and warming. Three cleverly hidden internal pockets enable the wearer to conceal three pouches' worth of objects with virtually no chance of detection.
6. The deceased wears a boxy platinum signet ring. It bears the distinctive sigil of an intricately graven rearing swan.
7. The deceased clutches a platinum coin in each fist. Two more platinum coins are wedged into its eye sockets.
8. The deceased wears a large gold and silver holy or unholy symbol around their neck on a plain leather thong. The thong is brittle and snaps if disturbed. The symbol is dusty, and in need of a good clean, but worth twice as much as normal.
9. A steel shield, decorated with the family's coat of arms, lies at the deceased's feet. A longsword, or another appropriate weapon, lies next to the body and also bears the same heraldic device.
10. A half-dozen dusty glass bottles—holding wine, brandy or other strong alcoholic drinks—are arranged around the corpse. The bottles' contents may—or may not—have succumbed to time's onslaught.
11. The corpse wears mouldering clothes of fine cut and make. The clothes are worthless, but their buttons are solid gold, and worth 1 gp each.
12. A large picture locket hangs around the deceased's neck. The clasp is stiff with age. The locket contains a faded picture of the deceased's love and a scrap of yellowed paper. A foul prayer of shocking blasphemy is scrawled on the paper. 





# CULTISTS' LAIR 




## VILE THINGS IN A CULTISTS' LAIR 



1. Ten blood-red candles containing teeth and fingernail clippings. When lit, the candles smell of fresh blood.
2. Three suits made from humanoid flesh and decorated with animal skulls, fur and feathers.
3. The faint outline of a summoning circle. Black, acrid smoke drifts up from it—seemingly from nowhere—and the air smells like tar.
4. Four humanoid skulls inscribed with symbols pertaining to the cult. Slips of paper with names written on them are stuffed into the skulls' mouths.
5. Three golden statues of local, good-aligned gods stained with fresh blood.
6. A gold encased skull of a demon or devil (worth 150 gp). The eyes glow dimly—and sinisterly—red.
7. A ten-foot-tall sculpture of a deity, entity or creature the cult reveres made from various parts of human limbs sown together. Smoke drifts from the statue's nostrils.
8. A pool filled with a strange, red fluid gives off a silver glow. It's not poisonous or magic but leaves a luminescent glow behind if smeared on anything. A horned, humanoid skull rests at the bottom of the pool.
9. The burnt remains of sacred holy texts and items smoulder on an obsidian altar.
10. This three-foot-tall idol of a squamous creature constantly oozes a thin, milky and slightly caustic ooze (and deals 1d4 acid damage if touched).
11. The tattered wings of an angelic creature are pinned to the wall with black, metal spikes.
12. Jars of various sizes contain the pulsating organs of a demon; all emit a stench of brimstone if opened.
13. Six corpses lying on slabs and awaiting reanimation— their hands have been removed and replaced with cruellooking weapons grafted onto the corpses' arms.
14. The skeleton of some giant painted black and engraved with unholy rites. It occasionally trembles slightly.
15. Two matching drinking vessels made from unicorn horns stained red with blood.
16. A gorgeously illuminated holy text except for the images of the good deity and its servants have been replaced with demons, devils or other strange creatures.
17. An altar fashioned from the small skulls of numerous tiny fey. Bloody tears weep from their sockets and the air around the altar smells like spoiled milk.
18. A pool filled with a green, viscous slime emitting a smell of decay and cinnamon.
19. A skeleton, half-dissolved, lies within a summoning circle inscribed with pulsating runes.
20. Four necklaces made from the teeth of an angelic creature and onyx (each worth 150 gp; if worn by a good-aligned creature the necklaces emit a profound aura of sadness). There is a 25% chance that touching a profane object has disastrous consequences.

SUBTABLE
1. The character is possessed by an alien entity until the next time they sleep.
2. A surge of profane energy envelops the character, dealing 2d6 damage.
3. The character sees horrific visions for the next hour, taking a –2 penalty on all rolls.
4. The character's alignment turns evil for 24 hours.
5. An angry evil outsider (demon, devil etc.) appears.
6. The character can only speak in an ancient, alien language for the next 24 hours.
7. For one week, worms and insects crawl out from the earth and woodwork wherever the character goes.
8. The character learns the true name of an evil entity who now wants that character dead.
9. The character has terrible nightmares of a vile, rotting city; they cannot regain hit points through normal rest for one week.
10. An evil doppelgänger of the character appears in a nearby settlement and causes mayhem and chaos. 





## THINGS ON A CULTISTS' ALTAR 



1. A curved bronze knife encrusted with dried blood lies next to a beaten copper bowl similarly covered in blood.
2. A black velvet cloth covers the altar. Atop it, a polished skull, fashioned into a drinking cup, stands on a small beaten silver tray next to a clay flask decorated with lewd images of demons cavorting with humans.
3. A small silver tripod holding a stone bowl along with several pots containing foul-smelling herbs have been neatly arranged on the altar.
4. Dried blood has stained this stone altar a foul brown/ black colour. The surrounding floor is similarly stained.
5. A three-pronged candlestick filled with red-hued candles stands in the exact centre of the altar. The candlestick is designed to look like a pair of lovers entwined in the midst of a particularly lewd act.
6. A wide oval bowl set atop the altar contains several rotting and shrivelled hearts.
7. A low pile of skulls—all bearing the signs of violence— covers the altar top. Emerging from the centre of the pile is a single thick blood-red candle.
8. A thin book—covered in some sort of aged leather—lies on the altar. It is kept shut by a ribbon woven from long, golden hair. The ribbon is frayed and speckled with dried blood.
9. The shattered shards of a mirror—laid out in a rough approximation of how the mirror would have looked when whole—lies on the altar. One large part of the broken glass is conspicuously absent. The glass of the shards present seems suspiciously clouded in places as if the mirror has trapped the image of the last thing reflected on its surface.
10. A single, foul-smelling burning candle stands atop the altar in the centre of a pool of wax that almost covers the altar top. The candle's flame dances wildly as if caught in a strong wind, but no wind is present in the chapel.
11. Channels in the altar top lead to a central depression with a small hole at the centre. Clumps of dried blood fill the channels and depression. A small knife, pointing towards the depression, lies at the head of the altar.
12. A thick tapestry covers the altar. The tapestry depicts angels being slain by a rampaging balor wielding a huge sword wreathed in dark energy. The tapestry is obviously old but is in good condition.
13. A battered helmet, the stump of a broken horn and a bent holy symbol crafted from blackest obsidian lie on a scarlet velvet pillow.
14. A set of five matching daggers is laid out on the altar. Each of the daggers has an oversized, two-handed handle and flecks of ruby set in its pommel. Each also has a litany to some dark power etched in Abyssal runes along the blade.
15. A scythe lies on the altar. Dried blood covers its blade, and wisps of blond hair are stuck in the blood.
16. Niches—seven in total—have been carved into the altar's surface. A polished skull—its top removed—fills each niche. A different type of incense fills each skull.
17. The slashed and bloody tabard of a servant of good— decorated with the wearer's patron's symbol—lies on the altar. The tabard conceals other trophies including a partially melted silver holy symbol, a battered mace head and the bones of a severed hand.
18. A skull stands at each corner of the altar. A dagger has been rammed through the top of each skull, and tied to their hilts are red, scarlet and purple streamers.
19. The altar is riven with a multitude of cracks. Bent and hammered coins—silver, gold and platinum—have been forced into the cracks—perhaps as offerings...
20. A low “fence” of leg and rib bones surrounds the altar. The altar comprises a great mass of bones glued together in some unspeakable fashion. Three long, curved horns emerge from the mass of bones; small banners depicting the symbols of various evil powers hang from each horn. 

## SMALL ITEMS FOUND ON AN ALTAR 



1. A small instrument (a bell, gong, cymbal, chime etc.)
2. An unholy symbol.
3. A prayer book.
4. Bones
5. A vial of unholy water.
6. A dagger or knife (probably blood-stained).
7. An offering bowl (possibly blood-stained).
8. Candles or a lamp.
9. An idol
10. Incense burner
11. A ceremonial mask
12. Offerings left by the faithful. 





## MAGIC EFFECTS ON AN ALTAR 



1. Heatless flames writhe atop the altar providing illumination equivalent to a bonfire. The flames leap 5 ft. into the air and never go out. They obscure the altar top itself, making it hard to see the hidden secret niche hidden therein.
2. This overly tall altar is of mortared stone upon mortared stone. The mortar comprises the ground-down bones of several champions of good, which bind the heroes' souls to the altar. Destroying the altar releases these spirits. Any sentient creature within 20 ft. of the altar hears painladen whisperings emanating from its stones.
3. The area around the altar is intensely cold. Frost clings to the altar and the surrounding floor, making the stone slippery. Cold-based spells cast within 30 ft. of the frigid altar take effect as if the spellcaster was one level higher than normal.
4. Four balls of obviously magical light hover in the air above the altar. They give off a lurid, green glow each equivalent to a torch. Anyone touching the altar can mentally command the four globes to fly anywhere in the chamber.
5. Strange whisperings emanate from the altar. These whispers grow louder or fade away depending on how many evil-aligned creatures are in the chamber. However, they never cease and explorers may believe the altar is possessed. If they grow loud enough to be heard, listeners can ascertain the whispers are tinged with pain and are a litany of praise for an evil god.
6. A line of skulls is mortared into the altar about three-foot above the ground. Unnatural, magical darkness lingers within the skulls' eye sockets.
7. Lurid, disturbing frescos depicting horrific acts of violence and torture decorate the sides of this altar. Further augmented by a powerful illusion, the figures in the frescos seem to shudder and writhe in pain.
8. Powerful magics pervade the altar and the area immediately surrounding it. Within this zone, all sound is greatly amplified making even the quietest whisper or groan of pain as loud as a shout.
9. The smell of ozone hangs heavily in the air around this altar adorned with thick manacles. An obsidian dagger lies on the altar. Anyone approaching the altar carrying or wearing metal armour or weapons is struck by a minor electrical discharge (2d6 electrical damage).
10. A permanent sphere of magical darkness is fixed to the altar; no nonmagical light sources can illuminate the surrounding area.
11. An illusion cast around the altar creates the image of mist continually rising from the floor. The mist provides concealment for objects and creatures further than 5 ft. away and cannot be dispersed by normal means (such as conjured wind and so on). Individuals who know of the illusion can see through the mist without penalty.
12. A prayer dedicated to the fane's dark powers is etched into the altar. Anyone reading the prayer hears dread whispers, urging the affected to kneel and worship.
13. A faint, sickly purple glow illuminates the altar providing light as a candle. This glow expands to cloak anything or anyone touching, or placed on, the altar.
14. Small holes in the altar top expel a strong breeze causing the permanently flaming torches set in wrought iron sconces atop the altar to dance wildly.
15. A protective circle is carved into the floor around the altar. Picked out with silver, it acts as a magic circle against good. Damaging the silver ends the effect.
16. A tall banner hangs from the ceiling directly above the altar, depicting the symbol of the altar's deity. A strong burst of wind continually affects the banner making it writhe and flap. Consequently, it is slightly colder around the altar than normal.
17. The altar is constructed of nothing but dozens—perhaps hundreds—of closely packed leg and arm bones. These fell remains emanate a constant unholy power.
18. The altar is the site of many contacts with creatures from beyond. The repeated use of such powerful magic in the locality has created a bridge of sorts to certain powerful, alien beings. A character asking questions within 15 ft. of the altar is assaulted with strange visions, alien thoughts and terrible feelings that haunt his mind.
19. A variant stone-forming magic affects the altar. The effect runs continuously and the altar's form is in a constant state of flux. While it always retains the general form of an altar, small details such as carvings, channels to catch the blood of sacrifices and so on appear and disappear seemingly at random.
20. A highly polished skull sits on a black velvet cushion atop the altar. A shard of obsidian fills one of the skull's eye sockets. The obsidian is the key to a magic prison of a paladin in stasis. Even dastardlier, a defensive circle surrounds the altar, which stops the paladin's pure soul from escaping… 





## THINGS TO FIND IN A CULTISTS' LAIR 



1. A large map of the nearby local populace. A number of houses of prominent townsfolk are circled though several have Xs through the circle.
2. Ten strangely feathered animal masks—each one as unique as its corresponding robe.
3. A small library of strange, forbidden, and in some cases heretical, books. To the right buyer, the collection is worth 200 gp.
4. A collection of five ornate knives (worth 50 gp in total) with strange creatures worshipped by the cult engraved in the blades and hilts.
5. A large straw effigy of a prominent local. Parts of it have been scorched with fire.
6. A large, human-sized cage. Spots of dried blood stain the metal floor.
7. A long scroll displayed prominently inscribed with the cult's ideology.
8. A small alchemist's lab with the ingredients to create five doses of a sleeping poison (save against poison or fall unconscious for 1 hour). The ingredients are volatile and likely to explode (4d6 points of fire damage) if not handled properly.
9. Six pairs of well-used iron manacles stained with old, dried blood.
10. Three fine silk robes (worth 25 gp each) emblazoned with holy symbols relevant to the cult. The robes belong to the cult's highest-ranking members.
11. A collection of fine silver and golden religious objects (worth 50 gp total) stolen from a local temple.
12. A crudely sketched plan of a nearby garrison or keep. Notes detail several possible ways to surreptitiously gain entrance to the place.
13. An exquisite noble's outfit (worth 50 gp). In the pocket is a potion allowing the imbiber to change minor details of their appearance.
14. A mummy-style wrapped corpse has an amulet (worth 75 gp) displaying a deity or creature important to the cult. The mummy's funerary wrappings indicate it was once a prominent member of the cult, now revered as a holy figure.
15. Four sets of uniforms belonging to the nearby town guard or local militia replete with the appropriate weapons and armour.
16. An eight-piece silver dining set (worth 40 gp) inscribed with images and motifs important to the cult.
17. Fifteen plain holy symbols hanging from a series of pegs. The holy symbols depict symbols and images meaningful to the cult.
18. Seven sealed scrolls containing missives to seven different people. The missives are written in code and need to be deciphered.
19. A long, rambling pamphlet describing daily religious routines for the cult's members to conduct and penalties for not doing so. Studying the pamphlet gives the character a +4 bonus if attempting to disguise himself as a cultist.
20. Eight vials containing human hearts floating in a foul, yellowish preservative fluid. Each vial contains a label with a name written on it belonging to a missing person in a nearby settlement. 

## UNHOLY BOOKS 



1. Tome of the Tentacled Masters: Little more than a collection of deranged ramblings about “the questing tentacles in the dark” this book has been handed down from cultist to cultist. Several different hands are evident in its writings.
2. Libram of Ineffable Damnation: This small, exquisitely bound book, describes—in excruciating detail—various torture and sacrifice rituals designed to consign the soul of the unfortunate subject into the clutches of various devils and demons. Several of the pages have dried, bloody fingerprints suggesting they may have been consulted mid-ritual.
3. Tome of the Sibilant Terror: Detailing many inventive and sadistic techniques for inducting new members into a cult, this tome is part “recruitment manual” and part blackmailer's handbook. Several notations in the book indicate various techniques are perfect for several named folk dwelling in the surrounding community.
4. Unnamed Book: This book has a plain cover and is untitled. Readers exploring its contents discover it is a diary chronicling the rise of the local cult. It provides a detailed history of its activities, victims and members. It is a useful resource to help the adventurers track down any cultists that have thus far escaped their notice. 





## CULTISTS WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Tanathrax (CE female tiefling wizard 3): A tiefling with red scales, slightly glowing amber eyes and a stubby tail, Tanathrax is convinced he comes from a draconic, rather than fiendish, bloodline. She involves herself in the cult as an enforcer but intends to subvert its goals to suit an ancient red dragon who has no idea Tanathrax exists.
2. Pendrake Abrogast (NE male human fighter 4): This rakish blond-haired, blue-eyed noble enjoys the benefits of his conventional good looks. He is known for his dalliances with all genders and debauched parties he throws at his estate. During days when he “nurses a hangover,” he actually participates in cult rituals, usually with the same people he partied with the night before. He believes the titled shall inherit the world and looks forward to the total subjugation or annihilation of the lesser folk (except those required to serve him).
3. Nelva and Quentin Indra (both NE halfling thief 5): This affable halfling couple once adventured together, but retired to open a general goods store. The grey-haired shop owners get to know everyone in their store and have remarkably keen memory for names and faces. They are astute observers and keep an eye out for potential victims, recruits or pesky adventurers.
4. Valdrin Boke (NE male human fighter 6): Valdrin has dirty blond hair and scars crisscrossing his body, but his face is injury-free. He wields a pair of daggers named after lesser beings associated with the cult and uses them for murders committed in the cult's name. The cult keeps him on a tight leash, but occasionally he escapes— or is released—to carry out his “sacred” duty.
5. Felice Granger (CE female human wizard 6): Felice has dark brown hair that turns bright red when she engages in her favourite activity: arson. She believes she can conjure forth actual hellfire. She has shown a surprising, yet unreliable, ability to start fires with a thought, which she believes comes from her invisible guardian devils.
6. Pastoran Fenn (CE male gnome cleric 3): Pastoran is a softly-spoken gnome cleric with a warm personality. He wears no holy symbol, claiming he is a servant of the people rather than some unseen deity. He enjoys spreading hope only to see it crushed afterwards and often convinces seriously ill or near-dead people to take their lives while he watches.
7. Odette Varyan (CE female human assassin 5): Odette, a human woman with dark brown skin, lived a sheltered life, overprotected by her father and older brothers and resented it. However, when she found her purpose in the cult, she realised she could use her perceived helplessness to her advantage. She pretends someone is following her or targeting her to lure unwitting protectors to their dooms.
8. Ghena Haroth (CE female half-orc cleric 4): This female half-orc paladin serves in an organisation with nobler goals than many cults, but the tyrannical regime she seeks to subvert refers to it as a cult. She is gruff and slow to make friends, partially out of distrust and partially out of the knowledge that her comrades often have short lifespans. She often makes difficult decisions about peoples' lives, causing her to seek atonement for her actions on a regular basis.
9. Mervynne the Prognosticator (CE male human wizard 5): Mervynne is a human man with tight, curly hair who makes a living as a fortune teller. While many of his fortunes are part of a convincing act, the proceeds from which fill the cult's coffers, he has some powers of divination. Specifically, he seems to be able to identify people whose paths intersect with the cult's plans.
10. Tessa (CE female half-elf fighter 5/thief 6): This half-elf woman leads the Twilight Performers, a carnival troupe, and she is the resident “beast tamer.” She often gains the trust of settlement leaders by stopping a rampaging monster—typically one she releases herself, but she does not pass up a convenient opportunity. She is never without her collection of whips. 





## THINGS TO LOOT FROM A CULTIST 



1. A polished knucklebone wrapped in a scrap of thin and threadbare red cloth.
2. A three-inch-high gold statuette depicting the cultist's patron. The statuette is crudely made (or is incredibly old and has become worn and dented through the ages).
3. This scarp of crumbled and torn parchment bears the name of a half-dozen locals. None are cult members; instead, this is a list of potential members (or perhaps a list of potential sacrifices).
4. A broad belt finished with a snarling demon head buckle holds up this cultist's trousers. The belt has a small secret compartment that would sit in the small of the back of the wearer big enough to hold a small unholy symbol.
5. This cultist's dreary brown cloak is double-lined and has a black inner lining. Its cowl is particularly capacious.
6. This curved iron dagger has dried blood on the tip. The crossguard is slightly wobbly and cured leather is wrapped around the weapon's handle.
7. This cultist wore a circlet of beaten bronze. The circlet— plainly old—has four empty settings, which clearly once held precious gems or some other form of decoration.
8. Wrapped in plain cloth and hidden in a large belt pouch lies a small (unholy) prayer book. It has a battered, mildewed cover.
9. A bloody work rag—used to clean a bladed weapon recently—fills this cultist's pocket.
10. This cultist has pierced his nipples (and several other parts of his body). In total, he wears six silver piercings. Each is worth 1 gp, but removing them requires them to be cut out.
11. A list of the party's names along with brief descriptions of their appearance and assumed abilities.
12. A plain copper bracelet encircles this cultist's left wrist. Several small charms—demon heads, claws and other fell things—hang from the bracelet and quietly jangle when moved. The charms are well made—but odious. A dealer in exotic art might pay 10 gp for them.
13. This cultist's shirt has a secret hidden compartment on the left side at the waist. Within, perceptive characters find a scrap of parchment extolling the virtues of the cult's dark lord and the cultist's signature under a pledge of unending allegiance.
14. Hidden at the bottom of this pouch, in a small semi-hidden pocket is a small golden coin. Practically worn smooth by time, the outline of some elder personality's profile is just visible.
15. A slender chain around the cultist's neck supports a small wooden unholy symbol of the cult's lord. The cultist's name is etched on the back of the symbol.
16. Deranged ramblings—“the lord's vengeance”, the “end of all things” and a “blood sacrifice”—cover this scrap of crumpled parchment.
17. A small sack full of blood-soaked earth destined for the cultist's garden; he believes it gives his foul crops a “certain taste".
18. A vaguely human-shaped fetish comprising pieces of string, hair and straw. (The fetish represents the cultist's hated neighbour who has been cursed).
19. A thigh bone wrapped in cloth and crudely etched with a number of deep incisions. The meaning of the plentiful marks is not clear but could be a count of the number of sacrifices the cult has made to its fell patron.
20. A diary detailing the cultist's struggle with the cult's unholy, distasteful practices. The writing reveals the cultist to be a reluctant adherent (at best) who dreams of fleeing the locality to begin a new life far away. 











# CURIO SHOP & PAWNBROKERS 





## CUSTOMERS 



1. Sakari Keto (N middle-aged male human) has little money and a large family to feed. He is here to sell his final valuable possessions. He is stressed, hungry and desperate to get a good price. Obviously malnourished, and his face care-worn and gaunt, his scraggly grey hair and sallow skin give him an air of quiet desperation.
2. Emmi Alanen (CN female human thief 1) is a petty criminal here to sell a few trinkets she recently “found”. Most are nothing more than cheap pieces of jewellery, but she is trying to pass them off as something more than they are. (If the characters seem gullible she tries to sell them the jewellery). She wears her dark brown hair cut short and dresses in clothes of dark hue and fashionable cut.
3. Elmo Karppanen (NG male human wizard 2) is a minor spellcaster suffering from an affliction of cowardice. He spends a lot of time in junk shops looking for things he can use (or sell on) as spell components. He has a small supply of such items for sale at his home but prefers to meet elsewhere such as a busy tavern. His eyes constantly dart about, which can make him seem untrustworthy. In truth, he is looking for an escape route in case negotiations go badly!
4. Thjoric Ovlag (LN male dwarf fighter 3) is bored, a little drunk and in a bad mood. Thjoric is looking for a friend (who is not here) and is getting increasingly annoyed. He barges past the group—they should get out of his way— and possibly knocks a character against a shelf (which might then collapse). Thjoric doesn't see he did anything wrong and is belligerent if challenged.
5. Rennesar Sehiatyn (LE male half-elf wizard 2/thief 3) is here casing the joint—not because he is thinking of robbing it but because he is planning to set up a rival business. He does his utmost to befriend the characters, even going so far as to find out where they live, what they plan and so on. He opens his shop a month later and tries to lure the characters to his business. With jet black hair, a thick—but neatly trimmed—beard and glittering black eyes full of intellect Rennesar does not appear as a typical half-elf.
6. Vilho Rintala (CN young male human thief 1) is a child of the streets and here on a dare. He is dirty, clad in clothes little better than rags and looks hungry. His long, tangled brown hair obscures his eyes, and his skinny frame hides surprising strength. Vilto is here to steal something—anything—to prove his bravery to his friends. Unfortunately, he is an unlucky thief; one of the characters or the shop's owner spots him slipping something into his pouch.

## ODDS & ENDS 



1. This small dusty bottle is half full of fine grey dust. Buried in the dust are three finger bones—probably from an individual roughly the size of an adult human male.
2. A worn leather backpack lies at the back of a shelf. The pack seems heavier than it should do. A careful investigation reveals a hidden compartment containing a small notebook. Much of the notebook contains doodles, random sketches and so on. At the back of the book a loose piece of ripped, aged parchment has a lavishly illustrated map that seems to depict the location of a buried treasure. Sadly, the map is incomplete.
3. A small stuffed lizard lies on its back amid other odds and ends. The lizard is missing one eye, but its scales are of a faded blue hue; hinting at (perhaps) some strange or magical ancestry.
4. These very long bright red boot laces are tied in a confused jumble of a knot. If someone takes the time to unravel the knot, they find a perfectly smooth white pebble at its heart.
5. A single blue and yellow-feather fletched arrow rests in a narrow quiver designed to hold no more than six missiles. The quiver has a drawstring at its mouth which can be tightened to stop arrows from falling out while the wearer is engaged in acrobatics, climbing and so on.
6. Only the front half of this horse has been carved from the block of wood from which it emerges. The carving is crude and it is more than possible the carver was only vaguely aware of a horse's anatomy.
7. Hanging from a fragment of a thin silver chain, this mouldy rabbit foot has a patch where the fur has been rubbed away.
8. This crudely drawn plan of an unnamed tavern has several arrows pointing to various windows on the first floor. Similarly, one of the bedchambers on that floor has been circled emphatically.
9. Used to weigh down a sheaf of papers this large chipped tusk may have come from an orc or halforc.
10. Roughly the shape of a spearhead this shard of obsidian is incredibly sharp.
11. Two shards of flint wrapped in an old, stained cloth are bundled into a slightly charred pouch.
12. This short and squat urn contains ashes and bone fragments. The death god's sigil on the lid hints at what might lie within.
13. Six desiccated spiders—of a variety of colours and sizes— are pinned to a display board hung at a haphazard angle from one wall.
14. A bunch of eight keys hang from an iron ring. The teeth of several keys are worn as it from much use.
15. This small child's rattle is shaped like a morningstar and painted in gaudy colours.
16. Mouldering in a shadowy corner, and covered by a sheet, this pile of wolf pelts has an indent that suggests one or more of the staff use this area as a place to slumber away from the shopkeeper's gaze.
17. Half full of dried and pressed flowers this small pocketbook has the look of a sage's project. Each of the various flowers is named in a beautiful flowing script, and each flower's medicinal uses are also noted.
18. This tarnished, dull bronze letter opener is shaped like a greatsword. In a pinch, it could be used as a dagger by a child, halfling or gnome.
19. Hanging from a frayed strap this faded black eye patch seems unremarkable. Investigations reveal, however, a tiny map drawn into its reverse side.
20. Missing its lid, this oak coffer holds several other small items on this list. 





## JUNK & DROSS 



1. Spilling from a cracked and suspiciously stained leather folder this sheaf of song sheets records a score or so bawdy drinking songs—or they would do if they hadn't suffered extensive water (or possibly beer) damage.
2. This pewter drinking stein has a wide crack in its base; consequently, any liquid inside quickly leaks out rendering it useless as a drinking vessel.
3. This slightly charred 1,000 gp letter of credit lacks the crucial section setting out who undertakes to extend the aforementioned credit.
4. Bent and twisted, this iron brooch forged in the shape of a (now squashed) pinecone has lost its pin.
5. This small drum has a rip in its cover.
6. The jagged fragment of a leather armband etched with the remains of a heraldic symbol—a lion rampant clutching a battle-axe—lies at the back of a shelf.
7. Containing slightly wet and matted multi-coloured chalk dust this pouch may have once belonged to a wizard.
8. A pair of blunt oversized brass scissors—perhaps good for shearing sheep if sharpened.
9. Hanging from a frayed length of red-stained leather this cracked monocle has an iron frame.
10. This small violin—sized for a halfling or a human child— has no strings and is missing its bow.
11. Soot covers the glass of this magnifying glass, which also has a slightly charred handle. Unless the soot is cleaned away it is not immediately obvious the glass is cracked.
12. Full of dry soil this waterproof leather pouch hides five large acorns.
13. Several of the names listed on this framed ornately drawn family tree have been scored out so violently there are holes in the vellum.
14. A matched brush and comb set. The comb is missing half its teeth and the brush is matted with hair and what is—hopefully—mud.
15. These four tarnished silver spoons each have an identical hole burnt through the middle.
16. A ragged, oversized quill crafted from the bright blue feather of some kind of exotic bird (or perhaps other creature). The quill is missing its nib.
17. A worn and much-used backpack looks at first glance like a serviceable bargain (as it is only half price). However, a close look reveals one of the straps is frayed. If the pack is filled, the strap breaks during its owner's first bout of strenuous activity.
18. This wrought-iron holy symbol (of a locally worshipped deity) has been poorly repaired; weld marks are obvious and the whole has a twisted—perhaps—warped aspect. (Perhaps this is intentional and an evil cult used it in a bastardisation of some holy ritual).
19. A wide crack runs around the mouth of this bright blue urn. The urn is fragile; any rough handling causes the top portion to slide off the body.
20. Draped in a stained red cloak, this life-size stone statue depicts a muscular man standing in a heroic pose. Removing the cloak reveals a certain part of the man's anatomy has been snapped off. 


## WEAPONS 



1. The haft of this mace is of dull iron worn smooth through countless hours of use. Similarly, the head is dented and chipped suggesting it has seen much combat.
2. Strange patterns and shapes—perhaps reminiscent of flames or serpents—seem to writhe in this dagger's blade when exposed to direct, flickering light (such as from a torch or campfire).
3. The hilt of this longsword is engraved with several esoteric sigils denoting victory and glory. The weapon's haft is well worn implying it has seen much action; however, the blade itself is in excellent condition.
4. The tip of this dagger has snapped off and all that remains is a wickedly jagged stump. The dagger's hilt and haft are wrapped in blood-stained worn leather.
5. This sword's pommel is carved from a large shard of onyx to represent a grinning skull. Additionally, ash has been worked into the blade and haft to give it a dull, dark grey appearance that seems to drink in the surrounding light.
6. Atop this stout haft sits a grinning iron skull. The skull has been painted white to appear more “real” but the paint is faded and chipped. Thus, the skull has a mottled— almost diseased—look. 





## BAUBLES & CURIOS 



1. A silver hairpin (worth 150 gp) designed in the shape of a lunging dragon. Tiny emeralds serve as the dragon's eyes. The hairpin is in need of a good polish. Unbeknownst to the shopkeeper, the hairpin is the sigil of a minor dragon-worshipping cult. If a character wearing the hairpin encounters cultists they initially believe her to be one of their own.
2. Four battered pewter cups along with a decanter are arrayed on a silver tray. Each is stamped with the heraldic device of a fallen noble house. The whole can be purchased for 100 gp.
3. A worn diary relates the “adventures” of Ignar the Wizard. He spends much of the diary complaining about his master's conduct and obsession with certain experiments the details of which Ignar dared not commit to paper. The diary stops abruptly in mid-entry.
4. A large hooded lantern sits on a table in one corner. It is wildly oversized—the owner claimed it was taken from a giant years ago. Whatever the truth of the matter, the lantern's oil reservoir is double normal size and it illuminates an area twice as large as a standard lantern. The lantern is on sale for 20 gp and weighs 6 lbs. empty.
5. A black oversized leather quiver—of sorts—hangs from a hook on the wall. The “quiver” holds 100 ft. of black, knotted silk rope. The whole is priced at 25 gp, but the quiver's design allows the rope to be deployed quicker than normal.
6. An old tapestry map of the area surrounding the town hangs from one wall. The map is dusty and worn and somewhat out of date. However, eagle-eyed browsers spot a tower standing deep in the hills or other inaccessible location. The tower does not appear on more recent maps.
7. A collection of wine bottles fills a shelf. Many have no label. One seems different to the others—its design hints at elven provenance and the wine it contains is exquisite. The wine is priced liked the other bottles—1 gp (but is worth 30 gp).
8. This tarnished silver choker is sized for a slender neck. It was set with three stones, but they have fallen out leaving only the empty mounts. Close examination of the inside of the chocker reveals the inscription, “Never Forget, You Are Mine.”
9. A three-panel privacy screen stands folded up and leant against a wall. The screen is dusty, but when opened reveals a lavishly painted ocean scene depicting an island with a distinctive mountain peak at its centre.
10. Faded and worn, this red velvet pillow has seen better days (and much use). It's quite lumpy, which could lead a suspicious (or optimistic) character to decide something is hidden within.
11. Comically oversized, these fine leather sandals are clearly sized for a giant of a man (or perhaps an ogre with a particularly refined taste in fashion).
12. This battered and dented silver thimble has faint faerie runes engraved all over its surface. Those who can read faerie translate the runes as a prayer of aid to an ancient nature goddess.
13. Tightly rolled up and shoved under a shelf, this tapestry depicts a mighty castle standing atop cliffs plunging down to a tumultuous sea. Close examination of the tapestry reveals several caves at the base of the cliffs.
14. Once a magical item akin to a scroll this shattered leg bone has faint etching recording a fragment of a powerful necromantic spell. No magic remains in the “scroll”, but a wizard may find it interesting anyway.
15. Slender and riven with minute cracks, this vase decorated with swirling wave patterns stands in splendid isolation atop a high shelf.
16. Depicting a rearing warhorse clad in chain barding this iron figurine is missing its rider.
17. Dust covers these four beaten copper dinner plates tied together with faded yellow string.
18. Perhaps sized for a child, this tiny brass ring is engraved with musical notes.
19. With a hood edged in luxurious white fur (from a polar bear), this blue cloak would be valuable were it not for the jagged rent in its back.
20. Exquisitely made, but worthless—assumable—as a weapon, this miniature crystal dagger is translucent and catches the light in beguiling ways. 





## COMPLICATIONS & OPPORTUNITIES 



1. The owner—or one of their staff—becomes suspicious of the characters. If they appear shifty, the owner accuses them of theft!
2. The shop owner wants to close early and asks the characters to leave.
3. Once the characters show a keen interest in a particular item, another customer swoops in and loudly declares he was about to buy it. An argument may ensue, and it is possible the party could make an enemy here. Alternatively, the other customer could be in the store owner's pay and be trying to drive up the price of the item in question.
4. As a character picks up an object to examine it, the shelf upon which it stands collapses, dumping its contents onto the floor with a crash. Unsurprisingly, the shop's owner is not best pleased and might even demand payment for any damaged items.
5. One of the characters spots a n o t h e r c u s t ome r a c t i n g s u s p i c i o u s l y . Pe r c e p t i v e characters notice the customer stealing something from the shop before trying to leave. The staff are oblivious. The customer could be a petty thief or could be reclaiming a stolen or lost possession of their own.
6. Whi l e brows ing, one of the characters feels inexplicably drawn to a certain item (use one of the other lists to determine which item). This feeling could be nothing, or the object could be a hook into a minor adventure. Alternatively, the item could even be possessed!
7. While examining an item, the character discovers something else of greater value hidden within. This discovery presents a moral q u a n d a r y — d o e s t h e c h a r a c t e r t e l l t h e shopkeeper what they have found, or do they buy the item a n d turn a healthy profit?
8. While the characters are browsing, a gang of thieves barges into the shop and try to rob the place. They could be merely after money, or they could have been hired to steal a particular item. If the characters intervene, the shop owner is grateful; in the future, the characters may learn of particularly choice items before they are put out for sale.
9. The shopkeeper recognises the characters as adventurers. If they try to buy something, the shopkeeper refuses their coin and asks (or demands) payment in the form of a favour.
10. The shop is shut. If the characters ask around, they discover it is rare for the shop to be shut at this time. 





# DARK CAVERNS 



## ATYPICAL CAVERNS 



1. This long, thin cave is barely 15-foot wide, but at least 30-foot high. A narrow ledge slopes steeply upwards towards the ceiling but disappears into a narrow opening in the wall. A light covering of rubble obscures much of the floor, but here and there it has been pushed aside into small piles. Another exit at the far end of the cave continues onwards.
2. A dense field of lofty, slender stalagmites fills the cavern. A narrow trail twists and turns through the stone forest; in several places, stalagmites have been deliberately smashed to forge a way through. Rubble lies heaped up against the pathway, creating the illusion of a sunken lane passing through a forest.
3. The sound of gentle rain fills the air. Two deep pools of crystal clear water, separated by a low, narrow ledge of polished stone, dominate this vast cavern. Water drips from a forest of stalactites hanging from the 40-ft. high ceiling. Some of the stalactites are so long their tips nearly brush the surface of the water.
4. The floor of this cavern descends through a natural set of three wide steps covered with loose rubble. A pool of clear, still water fills the lowest level of the cavern. Tiny albino fish swim through the pool's depths and small insects flit about its surface. Beyond the pool, two passages disappear into darkness.
5. A chasm, roughly 15-foot wide and of unknowable depth, cuts across the cavern. A slender stone bridge once spanned the gap, but its central portion has crumbled away. The bridge has no railings and is essentially a length of thin, flat stone seemingly grown from the chasm wall. (Perceptive characters will no doubt realise the stone bridge was created by magic).
6. A smooth, glistening stone column easily ten-foot in diameter rises from the cavern floor. Water oozes down the column, which has almost reached the cavern ceiling 20-foot above. Rubble covers the ground. Stone stumps thrusting up from the floor suggest many smaller columns once surrounded the remaining giant, but someone—or something—has smashed them to pieces.
7. The ceiling of this cavern is dangerously unstable. Dust sifts down from above and rubble covers the floor. Occasionally, the ceiling groans as the stone shifts and settles. In one part of the cavern—near another exit—part of the ceiling has already collapsed. The fallen rubble has formed a high natural breastwork of sorts and almost blocks the exit.
8. The muddy floor in this cavern slopes steeply upwards toward three exits piercing a rough wall down which splashes a small waterfall. Dirty water runs from the overfull pool at the waterfall's base down the sloped floor. The mud is thickest at the base of the slope. The going is difficult and dirty.
9. Much of this large cavern's floor has collapsed into a rubble-filled pit. Small pinnacles of yet stable rock thrust up from the rubble, providing determined adventurers with a means of continuing their exploration. The pit is deep; a fall from a rocky pinnacle results in a 30-foot fall. Four obvious passageways intersect this cavern although only three are easily accessible via the stone pinnacles. (Perceptive explorers spot a fifth, rubble-choked exit in the pit.)
10. Great cracks cut through this cavern's ceiling. A faint breeze and the stench of rot and decay emerge from these cracks along with long, flaccid roots. The roots reach all the way down to a network of small streams cutting through the cavern floor. The streams are sluggish; mould and lichen cover their steep banks. 


## ATYPICAL CAVERN ENCOUNTERS 



1. Beyond Ruin: The boundaries between the Material Plane and the decaying expanses of the Abyss are weak within this cavern. Leaching through the walls is a horrible brown sludge made up of rotting souls corrupted by a fiendish taint. Revelling in this chamber is a daemon-touched rust monster called Blight's Kiss. He is jealous of his realm and defends it to the death.
2. Death from Below: As the characters move through a large cavern, a hungry purple worm senses their presence and swiftly moves to attack. Perceptive characters may sense something large burrowing beneath them, one round before the purple worm bursts forth to consume them.
3. Enemy Within: The characters meet the svirfneblin rogue, Arumlen Stoneheart. Sadly, this benign gnome scout has recently fallen prey to Eirmurh Alymm, an intellect devourer. The intellect devourer is in search of a new body and the arrival of the characters provides it with the opportunity it has been seeking.
4. Mercenaries of the Ram: The characters meet a small band of mercenary minotaurs hunting for their hated enemies—troglodytes. The minotaurs are hunting the Black Spear troglodyte tribe. The two groups have been engaged in a war of skirmish and ambush for many years. Recently, the troglodytes' superior numbers proved decisive, resulting in the slaughter of the minotaurs' women and the destruction of their home. The minotaurs are ferocious warriors happy to slaughter weak-looking parties. However, their goal is to slay troglodytes and thus they do not immediately attack numerous or obviously-strong parties. In fact, they may even temporarily ally with the characters, if they are also fighting troglodytes.
5. Pillar of Twisted Glass: Nearly two hundred years ago, Safraz Akram, a djinn noble, struggled with the efreet Shani-el-Sharnassa across the planes. In a final gambit, Safraz ordered his sand mephit allies to envelop the blazing efreet, fusing them together as a massive, twisted pillar of glass. Unable to destroy the glass obelisk binding Shani-el-Sharnassa, Safraz hid his rival in a forgotten cavern deep in the earth.
6. Strands of Terror: The characters stumble into the lair of Deravnix, a gigantic, elder roper. This old and canny hunter has established himself in a cavern featuring a wide, deep chasm and waits for prey to come to him. Although evil and depraved, he enjoys speaking with those that have fallen into his grip
7. Taken for a Ride: The characters discover a small mining operation. Abandoned by its duergar owners forty years ago, when an insane de r ro a n ima t e d t h e mi n i n g equipment on a whim and turned them against the duergar, the area still possesses a threat to explorers. As the characters explore the tunnels, they come across a junction cavern used as a tools storage site and switching area for the mine's ore carts. The ore cart and tools are animated objects.
8. The Bleeding Lens: This cavern houses Kihsa, a woman cursed to bear the form of a medusa after she destroyed an ancient temple-library dedicated to the goddess of knowledge. Kihsa fled underground, chased as an abomination by her community, and lairs here, researching methods of regaining her natural form. Kihsa's monstrous visage is framed by writhing, barbed scorpion tails and her gaze transforms creatures into flawless glass.
9. The Last Nail: Last Nail is the blade made famous by Nornell the Havoctide on his bloody rampage through the Ebon Realm and the Bleeding Nights of slaughter in the lands above. No ordinary weapon, Last Nail is a vampiric mimic who devoutly worships battle and blood. His obsession holds him to the extent that he takes the form of a rust-coloured weapon and yearns to be wielded in sanguinary battle-feasts.
10. Whispers in the Dark: A small hunting band of derro lurk in this cavern. In the main, the cavern is quite ordinary, but in one corner, phosphorescent mould has grown over the skeleton of a fallen minotaur warrior. The leader of the derro, Jvix, enjoys using his powers to give the skeleton a semblance of life. He hopes this will draw travellers into the cavern so that his minions can launch their ambush. 





## CAVERN DRESSING 



1. The rubble from a broken stalagmite covers the floor, nearby to its stump that yet juts up from the floor.
2. A single booted footprint on the muddy floor betrays the passage of previous explorers.
3. Rubble covers the floor throughout this area, except for an obvious cleared path. Piles of rubble flank the pathway, creating areas difficult to move through.
4. Mud covers the floor and water drips from the ceiling above. The mud hides several deep hollows in the floor, which could trip unwary explorers.
5. The faint scent of burnt flesh reaches the party's nostrils.
6. Luminescent fungus covers one wall. Its faint glow reveals a narrow passageway slanting steeply upwards.
7. A narrow fissure little more than one-foot wide splits the floor in twain. A faint breeze emanates from below.
8. Three splintered crossbow bolts lie about the floor. None have any blood on their points.
9. A rocky outcrop on one wall looks a little like a melted giant's face emerging from the rock, in the party's flickering lights.
10. Water drips from a crack in the ceiling. Explorers passing through the area discover the water is very cold.
11. A cracked skull wearing a battered iron helm fills a small hole in one wall. It seems to watch those passing by...
12. Stalagmites and stalactites fill a low grotto to one side of the passageway. Shadows cluster thickly within, providing a perfect spot for an ambush.
13. A large, almost man-sized, mushroom once dominated this area. However, someone has recently hacked the mushroom down and its remains now lie mouldering near its low stump.
14. The sound of soft laughter followed by the soft clatter of shifting rocks comes from somewhere ahead.
15. A wide stream of clear, fresh water runs through the area. Several stones placed several feet apart provide a convenient means of crossing the steam while keeping one's feet dry.
16. As 15., but one of the stones shifts underfoot. The character must take care to avoid falling in.
17. Bats nest in the ceiling. A party bringing lights into the area disturbs them. They flutter about until the light source leaves.
18. Thick webs fill this area. A faint breeze issues from cracks in the rock causing the webs to gently undulate.
19. Thick mud covers the cavern floor. A discarded spade lies near a partially dug grave. A thick brown sludge of mud and water fills the grave about one foot deep. It is otherwise empty.
20. Translucent crystals stud the walls. Introducing a light source into the cavern creates a riot of colour. Crystals harvested from the walls shatter and are valueless. 



## NOTABLE CAVERN FEATURES 



1. Water drips through cracks in the ceiling, creating a liquid curtain. This provides a concealing mist that makes it slightly harder to notice enemies nearby.
2. Steep, but crude stone steps have been cut into the wall. The steps lead up to a small cavern that has obviously been mined at some point in the past. Perceptive characters notice glimmering flecks of unidentified metal in the walls. Subsequent examination by someone with mining experience reveals the flecks to be platinum.
3. This section of the floor is unstable. An object or person weighing more than 150 lbs. causes the floor to collapse into a water-filled sinkhole below. The 80-ft. deep (and cold) water breaks the falling character's fall, but falling rocks may prove fatal. The fragile state of the remaining portions of the ceiling means a trapped character cannot climb out without assistance.
4. A small stand of heligmites—stalagmites resembling trees with “branches” growing off the main body in erratic and bizarre directions—fills the area.
5. Thick, cloying mud covers the cavern floor. The mud covers and fills several deep pits in the floor. In these locations, the mud acts like quicksand. Unwary travellers —or combatants—could easily drown in such places.
6. A thin sheet of dripstone reaches from the ceiling to the floor. In several places near the floor, someone—or something—has chipped holes in the dripstone. The holes are large enough to fit a hand (or thrusting weapon) through.
7. Gour pools—pools whose rims stand about three-foothigh— dot the chamber. Within, water almost completely fills the pools. Water drips down from the ceiling into the pools; in this cavern, it sounds like it is raining. (This makes it harder to hear nearby adversaries.)
8. Long ago an explorer died in this cavern. His calcified bones remain, transfixed in a slowly growing stalagmite.
9. A bubbling pool dominates this chamber. A vauclusian spring rises from the rock in the centre of the pool and it is this that creates the bubbling effect.
10. Detritus and rubble obviously deposited by flooding cover the cavern floor. To the east, a trickle of water dribbles out of a cavern mouth high up one wall. The rock below the cavern mouth is notably smoother than that on other walls and glistens in the party's lights. 





## NATURAL CAVERN HAZARDS 



1. Rubble: Rubble and mud obscure the floor, making it uneven and slippery and slowing movement. In places, the rubble is precariously balanced and characters moving through the area without due caution could slip and fall.
2. Crumbing Escarpment: A crumbling escarpment cuts across the passageway, making further progress without climbing impossible. Loose rocks and small boulders cover the escarpment's face.
3. Crumbling Sinkhole: A water-filled sinkhole pierces the ground. The floor immediately adjacent is crumbling and unsafe (which a wary or perceptive character will notice). Characters entering an unsafe square may cause it to collapse. If it does, the character is dumped into the frigid and turgid 20-foot-deep water.
4. Fissure: A fissure cuts across the floor. Between 5- and 20-foot wide, a faint, cold breeze emanates from its depths. The fissure's rugged walls plunge 50 ft. and terminate amid a field of jumbled rubble.
5. Thick Mud: Thick mud coats the floor. In most places, the mud is little more than a few inches deep. In other places, however, it hides holes into which an unwary explorer could stumble. The holes range from a halffoot to two-foot deep.
6. Long Stalactites: Glistening stalactites hang down from the ceiling. In places, they are barely five-foot above the ground, forcing most humans to duck. Water drips down the stalactites, making the floor beneath slick.
7. Geyser: Mud covers the ground adjacent to a narrow hole piercing the floor. Every ten rounds, the geyser explodes coating everything within 20 ft. with thick, hot mud. The round before it explodes, perceptive characters hear a deep rumbling from far underground.
8. Stalagmites: Thick stands of stalagmites cluster about the area, creating areas of natural cover and concealment.
9. Precarious Boulder: A precariously placed boulder atop a steep slope looks like it could tumble downwards at any moment. Only a few smaller stones wedged under it keep it in place. Characters removing these stones cause the boulder to roll down the slope, crushing anything in its path.
10. Subterranean Stream: A subterranean stream cuts through the area. Its waters are cold and swift, and its bank steep. In most places, the stream is only about tenfoot- wide, but in one spot it widens into an irregularlyshaped pool.
11. Unstable Ceiling: Great cracks run through the ceiling. These cracks and the resultant rubble covering the floor are obvious to even the most unperceptive explorer. Loud noises, explosive spells or any kind of mining cause the entire ceiling to collapse, burying anyone caught underneath.
12. Powerful Wind: Powerful winds periodically rush through this narrow cavern. The winds are so strong they extinguish all unprotected flames and have a 50% chance of extinguishing protected flames such as lanterns. Three rounds before the wind fills the chamber, perceptive characters hear a moaning sound coming rapidly closer. Everyone hears the wind approaching on the round before it arrives. 





## LEGENDARY CAVES 



1. Cavern of Scaly Death: Named by nearby tribes of primitive humanoids, the Cavern of Scaly Death is a winding passage in the base of a volcano that leads to a prehistoric landscape of humid jungles, stalked by massive dinosaurs. Explorers' stories differ on whether the cave leads to some primordial valley, or somehow allows passage back through time, but either way, its reptilian inhabitants have been known to wander beyond the cavern.
2. Saldonator: Referred to by the elves as Saldonator, the so-called “wandering cave” is the subject of many campfire s tor ies . Bel ieved t o be a sort of extradimensional cavern, it is said to be able to appear on practically any rocky surface. According to the stories, the sudden appearance of a cave where there was none before prompts locals to investigate its depths, but the cave vanishes not long after, taking away any still inside.
3. Glittering Hall: No gem mine can command as much awe and greed as the Glittering Hall, a cavern hewn from a single massive vein of emerald. All attempts to mine the cavern end in tragedy: often when others seeking the mine's wealth take it by force, but sometimes for mysterious reasons, leading some to speculate the caverns may be haunted.
4. Twisting Caves of Armallao: The Twisting Caves of Armallao are considered by many a marvel of spellcraft. Notoriously maze-like, they defy the laws of physics, with multiple paths and chambers seemingly occupying the same space, and paths looping around to places they could never actually connect to. Some believe the cavern is several different caves, connected by undetectable portals, meaning it may be possible to use the caves to travel vast distances quickly.
5. Deephold: Deephold is an unusual city, built inside a hollowed-out mountain of the same name, and accessible only by a handful of different cavernous tunnels. Built by dwarves, but now inhabited by a mix of races, it is all but impossible to assault, and this safety is well worth adjusting to a sunless existence, in the minds of its inhabitants.
6. Kragomak: Kragomak, the Living Cavern, is a massive cave structure rumoured to not only be alive in some fashion but also sentient. The cave doesn't appear any different from any other cavern, but tales say the passageways move and shift on their own, including highly-localised cave-ins and collapses which are difficult to explain, and that certain chambers, although clearly inorganic in nature, seem oddly reminiscent of organs.
7. Imperial Underway: The Imperial Underway was an ambitious attempt to carve a massive tunnel through an imposing mountain range. Plagued by numerous setbacks, a tragic collapse in one of its support tunnels left over a hundred miners trapped and unable to escape, but because of an engineering quirk, their voices were still audible in the main tunnel. For days, miners in the main tunnel listened to the voices of the trapped and dying, who they could not reach. Afterwards, persistent rumours of ghostly voices eventually put an end to construction, leaving the tunnel half-finished.
8. Ice Maze of Dar'lessi: A complex and dizzying network of ice tunnels submerged in a frozen lake, the Ice Maze of Dar'lessi is a frigid death trap. As though the cold and the water weren't bad enough, the ice is nearly perfectly transparent, making it all but impossible to see where the passageways turn, branch or come to a dead end.
9. Ylanic Puzzle Stone: Some scholars debate whether the Ylanic Puzzle Stone can truly be called a cave or not, considering the entire twisted network of stone tunnels floats, by some unknown magic, nearly a mile above the ground. At a glance, it appears to be a flying island, but closer examination reveals the entire rock structure is completely made up of what appears to be a single stone tube, roughly 20 feet in diameter, which was somehow rolled up onto itself like a ball of string. Rumours of what might be found at the centre of the Puzzle Knot are wild and varied.
10. The Pit: An opening in the ground that bears an unnerving resemblance to a grinning demonic face, legends say The Pit, as the locals call it, is a literal tunnel into the Abyss. The flickering red light that is often reported from deep in the tunnel and occasional wailing sounds do little to quell these rumours. 





## THINGS IN A SUBTERRANEAN RIVER 



1. A monstrous skull of some large, undoubtedly ferocious creature lies at the bottom of the river, partially covered in silt. It lies near the narrowest part of the watercourse.
2. This river is surprisingly deep. At its deepest point, perceptive characters spot what looks like a small cairn. Partially covered in silt it is completely submerged and looks like it's been there for a long time.
3. A bedraggled and ripped brown cloak is snagged between two large boulders. The sodden cloak is half in and half out of the water. It is cut for a halfling-sized creature (or perhaps a human child).
4. The rusty hilt of a notched two-handed sword juts from the water. Any attempt to pull the sword from the water snaps the blade.
5. A large stone has been dumped in the middle of the river to act as a stepping stone. Unfortunately, it is precariously balanced—unwary explorers will likely be dumped into the frigid water as the stone shifts unexpectedly underfoot.
6. A school of tiny, albino fish live in the river. Constantly hungry, they swarm any potential source of food dumped in the river.
7. Part of the riverbank has collapsed, partially damming the watercourse. The collapse has narrowed the river, and thus this is an easier place to cross.
8. Several pieces of splintered wood—perhaps remnants of a spear's haft—bob in the water.
9. In this river, a stretch of water is discoloured by minerals in the rock; perceptive explorers spot a faint pink tint to the water. Paranoid explorers might suspect something— or someone—has recently bled into the river.
10. A sunken rowboat, sodden rope still wrapped around a prominent rock on the bank, lies at the bottom of the river. One of the boat's oars floats nearby, wedged among the rocks.
11. Two abandoned crudely crafted wooden buckets stand on the river bank. One has been knocked over, but the other is full.
12. Someone—or something—has cut a crude set of stone steps into the river bank where the river widens—and thus the water slows. A metal ring sunk into the wall provides evidence that once a boat was moored here.
13. Crystals embedded in the river bank glimmer invitingly below the water if the characters' lights reach the area.
14. Here, the river flows over a roughly man-high rock shelf into a wide pool before continuing onwards. The sound of the water tumbling into the pool is audible from quite some distance.
15. Fronds growing from a great swath of lichen on the cavern roof dip down to the river's surface, creating a curtain of sorts that those navigating the river must pass through to continue.
16. The corpse of a bat twice the size of a normal specimen bobs up and down on the river as it is carried passed the party. Perceptive characters notice the bat's head has been ripped off.
17. The cavern roof drops down almost to the surface of the water. Those in boats or on a raft must lie flat to proceed.
18. A small channel blocked by a rusted portcullis runs away from the river's main course. A mass of branches and other rubbish bobs in the water before the portcullis.
19. A line of rusting iron spikes about three-foot apart has been hammered into the river bank. There are sixty spikes in total; the last in the line trails a ten-foot-long length of sodden rope.
20. A thin crack in the ceiling lets a solitary beam of light play upon the river's surface. The shimmering glimmer is noticeable from quite some distance. Perhaps subterranean predators have learnt the light often attracts prey and already lurk nearby, ready to pounce... 





## THINGS TO FIND IN A PURPLE WORM 



1. Several large shards of seemingly tough rock. If they are dumped out of the purple worm's stomach, they disintegrate into soft shards when they hit the ground.
2. The hilt of a once fine longsword. A shard of the blade is yet attached to the hilt, which was once decorated with golden runes; now only scraps of the gold inlay remain.
3. An iron potion vial without its stopper. Filled with the purple worm's digestive juices, the vial must be rigorously washed before being used for its original purpose. (And, of course, a new stopper must be found.)
4. The remains of an iron-shod rod, now much damaged by its time in the worm's stomach. The rod's beaten iron tip remains, but much of the once potent magical item has been reduced to a mass of sodden wood.
5. Seven pitted iron spikes. If hammered into a tough surface such as stone, each has a 25% chance of bending or breaking.
6. This purple worm consumed a duergar rogue several weeks ago who was carrying a sack of coins. The duergar has long since been all completely digested. However, some of the coins have survived, but are badly damaged. They are now only good as scrap metal but if melted down are worth a total of 75 gp.
7. The remains of six skeletons and remnants of several pitted steel weapons—pick heads—fill the worm's stomach. (This was a party of svirfneblin miners the worm gobbled up).
8. A fine cold iron (but nonmagical) dagger pierces the back of the purple worm's throat—wedged there by the worm's last victim as he tried to climb out. The dagger is unaffected by the worm's strong digestive juices.
9. Nine small shards of iron ore. Individually, none are large enough to forge a weapon, but together there is enough to create a longsword or similar weapon. The worm's stomach acid has impregnated the ore and if such a weapon is enchanted, it continues to ooze the worm's deadly on every hit.
10. A partially dissolved iron helmet sized for an ogre or similarly large creature. However, the helmet has no eye holes. (This is the head of an iron golem destroyed by the worm months ago.)
11. A six-foot-long iron pole wholly unaffected by the worm's stomach acid. Once the personal weapon of a dwarven monk, the iron pole is in fact a quarterstaff.
12. The stone in the worm's stomach comprises obviously once fine stonework including intricate carvings of elves and demons. (The worm recently attacked and partially destroyed part of a drow fortification before being driven away and this could provide a clue that such an enclave lies somewhere nearby.)
13. The worm's stomach contains a great mass of pitted and decaying bones. Scraps of flesh hang here and there to the bones, but they are generally in a terrible state. They appear to have belonged to a variety of creatures.
14. A careful search of the worm's stomach reveals four arrowheads crafted from an incredibly hard metal (adamantine) that are untouched by the worm's strong digestive juices.
15. A decaying skeletal hand yet clutching a wickedly curved dagger. The dagger is chipped and worn, and the blade is loose in the hilt. It is worthless.
16. Chunks of undigested stone fill the worm's stomach. Some pieces are as large as a halfling. If a character cuts open the worm's stomach without taking care the stones slide out and crush the character's foot.
17. The torso of a dark elf wearing the remains of a finely crafted chain shirt. The chain shirt is of ordinary make but has offered some minor protection to the elf's torso. Of the rest of the drow, only bones remain.
18. Several chunks of stone hold glittering flecks that at first glance look like gold. A close look, however, reveals them to be nothing more than pyrite.
19. The worm's stomach contains several heavily degraded pieces of metal.
20. This worm has recently consumed an adventuring party. Although most of the party is no more, one of its members was wearing a ring that can regenerate limbs when he died. The ring is heavily damaged by the worm's stomach acid, but some magic yet clings to its golden band (although its large green sapphire is missing). Due to its damaged state, its effects are diminished. To repair the ring, its large green sapphire must be replaced and powerful magic must be cast on the whole thing once a week for a month. 





# DRAGON' S LAIR: BLACK DRAGON 



## LAIR FEATURES 



1. A large pool of fetid, dirty swamp water covers the floor in this area. In places, the water is almost ten-foot deep; sometimes the dragon bathes, here.
2. A wide swath of deep, glutinous mud covers the ground. The mud smells noxious and is thigh-deep in places. If the dragon has recently passed by here, its tracks are visible in the mud.
3. A tangle of roots grows down through the ceiling and quests almost all the way to the floor. The roots form a thick curtain of sorts that obscures whatever lurks beyond. Things might live in the roots or perhaps the dragon has interwoven pieces of metal in the fibrous growths. Incautious characters passing through the roots cause the broken shields, bits of armour and so on to jangle together.
4. A sinkhole pierces the lair's ceiling; mud, fetid swamp water and the occasional swamp denizen fall into the hole and end up in the lair. Faint light filters down through the sinkhole dimly illuminating the surrounding area. If the sinkhole is wide enough, the dragon may use it as a secondary way into and out of its lair.
5. A large rotting tree trunk, its leaves branches ripped off lies on its side in the mud. Mud coats the trunk, which must be climbed over to get further into the lair.
6. Part of one wall has collapsed creating a viscous field of mud and rubble which partially blocks the corridor. Perceptive characters notice the wall around the collapsed area is pockmarked with acid scars and slightly melted in places. Characters digging through the rubble—a long, dirty job—may discover the remains of some of the dragon's foes (Perhaps, some of the interlopers' equipment has also survived).
7. M o s q u i t o s , a n d o t h e r annoying, biting, insects, swarm in this area. They greedily attach to any exposed skin and generally ma ke the explorer s ' l i ves miserable.
8. A high, steep bank of mud cuts the area in half. Several small dirty rivulets flow down the escarpment creating a small pool at its base. Explorers climbing the bank discover it is slippery, and they get muddy.
9. A few cut and dressed stones sunk into the mire hint at some ancient stone wall or other building. Investigations reveal indistinct carvings worn down by immersion in water and mud decorating some of the stones.
10. Deep bogs, intermingled with shallower pools only about one-foot deep, pockmark the floor. The deep bogs are almost four-foot deep.
11. Foul swamp water oozes down the walls of this low-lying area. The floor appears to be normal—just mud—but is in fact quicksand almost 15 ft deep.
12. The ceiling is unstable and riven with deep cracks. Excessive noise—the sounds of loud combat—or explosive spells or the dragon's breath weapon striking the ceiling causes it to collapse, burying everyone under piles of sodden mud.

## LAIR DRESSING 



1. Small patches of melted metal pockmark the lair's floor.
2. Gouges in the wall show where the dragon has sharpened its claws. Clever characters can use the marks to estimate the dragon's size.
3. Pitted bones cover swaths of the floor. Many show the tell-tale marks of acid; others are crushed and smashed.
4. Small pools of stagnant water fill hollows in the floor.
5. A thin sheen of mud covers the floor; the bones of several creatures—perhaps lizardfolk, crocodiles or the like—jut from the glutinous paste.
6. The stump of a discarded, mud-covered torch lies on the muddy floor. Nearby, deep footprints head deeper into the lair.
7. Several small hummocks of drying mud dot the area. The largest of the hummocks is almost three-foot-high; the hummocks resemble overly large molehills.
8. The entrance to a small ants' nest pierces the floor; here, hundreds of ants scuttle about their business.
9. The decomposing body of a lizardfolk lies partially buried in the mud. One of the lizardfolk's legs is missing.
10. A confused miss mash of tracks crisscrosses the area. The tracks go hither and thither; in a few places, a larger —draconic—footprint overlays the others. A skilled tracker can tell many of the tracks were made by folk running.
11. Someone or something has excavated a deep hole near a wall. The hole is about ten-foot de e p a n d i s slowly filling with water; claw marks are evident in the mud—perhaps the dragon, or o n e o f i t s servants, dug the hole.
12. The dragon's name is scratched into the wall in overly large, crude letters. The name is written in the language of dragons; its meaning may not be immediately evident to the characters. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: DISTINGUISHING MARKS 



1. A vivid patch of white scales highlight's the portion of the dragon's chest between its front legs.
2. A livid, dirty scar runs down the dragon's left front leg. By the looks of the scar, the wound never healed properly. The dragon favours its other leg.
3. One of the dragon's eyes glimmers balefully at its enemies; a mass of scar tissue surrounds the other milky white eye.
4. The dragon's two horns are curved into tight spirals and are set close to the creature's head.
5. The dragon's frill is tall, but ragged, and extends about three-quarters of the way down its long, sinuous neck.
6. Foul-smelling, slightly steaming drool drips from the dragon's jaws. Several of the beast's lower fangs end in jagged, blackened stumps.
7. The stench of rotting vegetation and fetid swamp water intermixed with a slight, noxious tang of chlorine emanates from the dragon.
8. The dragon's red-rimmed eyes are different colours; the left eye is blue, while the other is green. 





## MINOR SIGHTS, SOUNDS & EVENTS 



1. A faintly acidic smell hangs in the air; it is heavier, closer to the floor and is particularly marked in the “low-lying” portion of the lair.
2. Dirty swamp water drips from the ceiling. The constant pitter-patter of water hitting the floor makes hearing subtle sounds in the lair harder.
3. From the direction of the lair's entrance, a faint wind sighs through the area; it plucks at the water or mud coating the floor creating small wavelets that break against the chamber walls and the characters' ankles.
4. Small pieces of mud fall from the ceiling and land on the floor with quiet splatting sounds. Alternatively, the mud splashes into a nearby muddy puddle.
5. A quiet squelching sound reaches the characters' ears, from deeper into the lair.
6. A faint, low mist covers the ground, giving the mud an odd, ethereal look. The mist swirls and eddies about the characters' ankles as they move through the cavern— paranoid characters may think the wisps of mist resemble tentacles reaching up from the floor.
7. A sudden splash from a nearby pool shatters the quiet. Something might lair in the pool or perhaps something fell into the fetid water. Ripples overflow the pool's bank.
8. A small sickly green-coloured swamp viper slithers across the floor; it is not aggressive and flees if attacked.
9. Perceptive characters hear a quiet, low chuckle from somewhere deeper into the lair. The chuckle goes on for about half a minute before fading away.
10. A sudden but brief gust of sullen wind redolent with the smell of decay and the faint hint of marsh gas sweeps over the party.
11. A jumbled mass of pitted and partially melted bones, intermingled with scraps of rotting and rusting equipment, shows where another adventuring party met their doom. The dragon has removed any surviving treasures or trinkets to its hoard; there is nothing of value here.
12. The characters encounter a pocket of fetid swamp gas. Perhaps the gas was blown into the lair from outside or this area has a particularly high concentration of noxious gases. In any event, the smell is revolting and the party's natural light sources turn blue and flicker sullenly. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WHAT'S THE DRAGON DOING? 



1. The dragon is sleeping on its back after a large meal of melted elf. The beast is unprepared for battle and furious to discover intruders in its lair.
2. The dragon is slowly pulling apart two lizardfolk corpses and eating them in a surprisingly dainty fashion. The smell of melted flesh gives the party some clue to what they will discover before they enter the chamber.
3. The dragon is faking sleep and is expecting trouble (either it has noticed the intruders or its sixth sense has alerted it to impending danger). It has already cast any long-duration protective spells it knows.
4. The dragon is happily sorting through its hoard, examining its most beloved treasures. It is muttering and chuckling to itself when the characters arrive.
5. The dragon has just finished torturing and eviscerating a captive. As the characters arrive, it tosses aside the limp corpse and licks the unfortunate's blood from its claws.
6. The dragon is stalking about its lair in search of one of its treasures that it has just discovered is missing. It is muttering loudly about thieves and what it will do to the thief when it captures him.
7. The dragon is rubbing its scaly body into the mud coating one wall and moaning with pleasure as it covers a hard-to-get-at itch.
8. The dragon is a devout worshipper of Tiamat. When the characters arrive, the dragon is praying to his dark mistress in hopes of gaining some unspeakable boon. Thus, he sees the intruders as a test (or perhaps a gift) sent by Tiamat herself! 





## HOARD TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. A spear rests upright against a wall, chest or another large piece of treasure. Its shaft is fully ten-foot long and its point is long and tapered. Several tribal charms— feathers, strips of snakeskin and the like—now caked in dried blood hang from the haft.
2. A book entitled, “Vilimzair Aralivar: His Amazing Life” lies open on an upturned chest. The book's title is embossed in gold leaf and the pages are rendered in beautiful, flowing elven script. The book details—briefly—the life of the legendary pirate-bard Vilimzair Aralivar and his motley band of inept followers.
3. A black-stained hardwood mask of a leering crocodile face leans against a pile of coins. The mask has lost the straps that once held it to a warrior's face, but is an excellent example of a local lizardfolk tribe's war masks.
4. A muddy silver mechanical bird lies on its side at the bottom of an ornate, blood-splattered silver cage. The bird has tiny red, glimmering eyes crafted from flecks of ruby. The bird's key still nestles in its chest; turning the key activates the bird which then sings and flutters its wings for four minutes.
5. Four small jade statuettes are scattered throughout the hoard. One depicts an owlbear, another a minotaur and the last two archaic hunters dressed in simple garb. The four statuettes are obviously a set.
6. Bound in scarlet-hued leather this large book bears the title, “Dragons and their Ilk”. The book's yellowed pages are mud-stained and dried blood mars several pages.
7. Its collar and hems decorated with fine silver thread woven into all manner of arcane symbols this bright blue wizard's robe is surprisingly intact and unblemished.
8. This bright white hunting horn crafted from a unicorn's horn hangs from a short supple leather thong.
9. This thin, narrow box is beginning to rot, but its contents —two bolts of red silk—are in excellent condition.
10. Rolled up tightly in a watertight iron scroll tube, this parchment map depicts—in exquisite detail—the surrounding swamp.
11. The hilt of this five-foot-long greatsword is missing— melted away by the dragon's breath. The sword's blade, however, is in excellent condition and remains sharp. If repaired, its workmanship is so fine it could be used in the crafting of a magical weapon.
12. Thin and fragile, this plain platinum ring is sized for a halfling—or perhaps a human's smallest finger.
13. Finished with a greenish copper wash, this fine plate armour has elaborate dragon-shaped pauldrons.
14. This small steel shield has a single, wickedly curved spike protruding from its boss.
15. The graven symbol of the dwarven god of war decorates the heads of this heavy all-steel warhammer.
16. This once fine golden statuette depicted a dragon curled up asleep. The green dragon has vandalised the statuette, however, prizing out its gemstone eyes (which lie somewhere in the hoard) and scratching and melting some of the statuette's finer features.
17. Delicately wrought, this large, almost man-sized porcelain vase has delicate blue and red wave-like patterns painted all over its body.
18. This black onyx paperweight is carved into the shape of a rampaging boar.
19. A sodden and ruined velvet pouch holds a set of five ivory six-sided dice.
20. This sable battle standard bears the plain white crest of a rampant swan. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WORN TRINKETS 



1. This dragon has daubed several strange symbols on its chest using different colour mud. The mud is dried and cracked. The symbols are decorative and don't mean anything in particular, but some characters may waste valuable seconds trying to discern their meaning.
2. The dragon wears three large, heavy gold bands as eyebrow rings. The three rings faintly jingle when the dragon moves its head violently.
3. The dragon wears an oversized golden teardrop-shaped pendant on a thick silver chain around its neck. Faint cracks criss-cross the pendant's surface; they could have magical powers or are merely decorative. (Alternatively, the pendant could be the broken phylactery of a longdead lich.)
4. A beautifully wrought leather bracer with sigils picked out by thin silver wire covers one of the dragon's claws.
5. The dragon wears a plain silver torc as a monocle.
6. A massive earring of gold, silver and brass shaped like a grinning skull hangs from the dragon's left earlobe. The earring is of giant-craft.
7. The dragon wears a thick, iron signet ring on the smallest finger of its left claw. The ring bears the heraldic symbols of crossed spears over a crocodile's head.
8. Two cloaks sized for halflings or gnomes—one blue, the other red—are woven together to form a jaunty scarf of sorts that the dragon wears about its neck. The dragon is proud of its scarf and tries to keep it clean. 





## HOARD DRESSING 



1. Pieces of broken and splintered wood lie intermingled with the dragon's hoard. All are rotting and decayed.
2. Skulls of the dragon's slain enemies are set about its hoard atop decaying wooden stakes or spear shafts driven deep into the ground.
3. A rotting barrel partially sunken into the mud holds several weapons including two spears, a rusting longsword and a longbow without its string.
4. A chest lies amid the dragon's hoard; its lid has long since been snapped off, but the dragon still uses the chest to hold treasures that might be ruined if they got muddy or wet.
5. The dragon has created raised beds and pillars of mud to better display some of its choicest treasures. These rise above the main body of the hoard to a height of between five and 15 ft. Some of the pillars are slender affairs that collapse if anyone tries to scale them.
6. Shallow channels gouged into the floor divert the worst of any fetid swamp water away from the dragon's bed and hoard. Bones and the remains of various animals— and perhaps previous would-be dragonslayers—choke some sections of the channels.
7. A small pyramid comprising a score or so skulls watches over the dragon's hoard. Golden coins have been delicately placed in each skull's eye sockets.
8. Faded, mud-streaked tapestries hang down the chamber's walls. The wall hangings comprise not just tapestries, but rugs, battle flags and the like all taken from the dragon's previous victims. The party may recognise some of the flags as being from vanished adventuring companies, questing nobles and the like.
9. The dragon has scratched a crude map of the surroundings on the ceiling of the cave. The map depicts various settlements and the like as well as several mysterious caves which the party did not know previously existed. The dragon has also drawn various figures on the map—humans, lizardfolk and the like to remind it which races live where.
10. A cunning, but crude, trap wards the chamber. The dragon has excavated a deep pit in front of the chamber's entrance and roofed it with branches covered in mud. Characters stepping onto the seemingly solid floor plummet into a fetid, mud-filled hole.
11. A rusting set of partially melted plate armour lies among the hoard. The rotting, disembowelled corpse of a muscular man yet lies within. He has clearly been dead for months. The plate mail is, sadly, ruined.
12. The sodden bloodstained remains of a once fine lady's riding saddle lie upturned amid the hoard, covered with coins and other precious objects.
13. A plain set of pan pipes crafted from hollowed bones and lashed together with green and red string lies hidden among other treasures. Perhaps a gem or two is wedged inside the pipes and might be overlooked by casual searchers.
14. A large iron-banded chest lies on its side, its lid shut, but not locked. The chest is filled with mundane bits and bobs that have captured the dragon's interest.
15. Shards of a smashed tankard lie at the bottom of a shredded, rotten backpack along with a coiled black leather whip.
16. An apothecary's set of pouches still attached to a stout belt encircles the waist of a skeleton buried under the hoard. The pouches contain nothing but rotting herbs and spoiled unguents and the like. The whole smells slightly off-putting.
17. Mushrooms sprout among the hoard; some are small while others have grown monstrously large.
18. Rusted and pitted with age this 20-foot-long sinuous iron chain lies like a huge slumbering snake under the dragon's hoard.
19. Ten jars of honey fill a straw-filled box. Although the straw is rank and rotten, the honey is perfectly edible.
20. This brass candelabra lies on its side in the mud. Originally designed with six arms, one of them has snapped off and is lost elsewhere in the hoard. 





# DRAGON' S LAIR: BLUE DRAGON 


## LAIR FEATURES 



1. A deep drift of fine, shifting sand fills the area. Blown here by the wind—or perhaps placed by the cunning dragon—the sand swirls and billows about when a strong wind—such as that caused by the beating of mighty wings—sweeps through the area.
2. A small subterranean stream flows beneath this area, creating a weak spot in the floor. Characters weighing more than 80 lbs. walking on the unstable section cause it to collapse into a 10-foot-deep crevice running across the chamber. Unfortunately, quicksand fills the hole.
3. Rippled dunes of sand fill the passageway, blocking line of sight. Cunning characters can use the dunes as cover to get deeper into the lair. The wind has effaced all tracks of previous explorers (or lair occupants) although here and there white bones emerge from the sand.
4. A deep, sand-filled crevasse splits this area in two. The fissure appears to be only 20-foot deep but is filled with soft sand to a depth of 30-foot. Characters falling into the sand sink slowly to the bottom. (Alternatively, the dragon—or its servitors—could lurk below the sand; they wait for the characters to pass by before emerging to attack intruders from behind.)
5. A series of hidden sinkholes lurk beneath the sand, ready to entomb explorers. Characters walking across a sinkhole cause it to collapse into a sandy pit. Even worse, sand continues to flow into the sinkhole from the surrounds for 1d6 rounds (potentially suffocating a victim caught within).
6. A forest of strange, albino cactuses grows throughout this area. Some of the cacti are as large as small trees; all have prickly, thorny growths.
7. A veritable swarm of scorpions dwells here. Their tracks are easily visible in the sand, and—curiously—the dragon hasn't killed or driven forth this vermin. (The dragon uses the scorpions as an intruder alarm and even encourages their numbers to grow by dumping the occasional corpse in the area for them to feed upon.) The bones of several creatures festoon the area.
8. A high drift of sand lies piled up against one wall. The drift obscures the entrance to a passageway or chamber beyond. (The dragon simply burrows through the sand). Perceptive characters may find the placement of the sand odd—the rest of the area is not similarly buried in deep sand).
9. Sections of the wall and ceiling throughout the lair are blackened, scorched and even melted—hinting at the awesome power of the dragon's lightning breath. In some places, where the ceiling bears scorch marks, it has collapsed dumping piles of rubble onto the floor. Beneath some such piles may lie the crushed, broken remains of those who sought to slay the dragon.
10. A large colony of bats—tolerated by the dragon as a natural early-warning system—lairs on the ceiling. If disturbed, they swarm before fleeing the light source; they fly toward the lair exit or some deeper recess of the cave; they do not fly toward the dragon's inner sanctum.
11. A dense field of rubble and boulders covers the floor. Placed here deliberately by the dragon to make exploration by land-bounded creatures harder, some of the stones shift alarmingly underfoot. Characters wise in the ways of caves can determine the rubble came from the ceiling; a close examination of the ceiling reveals deep claw marks suggesting the rockfall is not natural.
12. A wide, deep pool blocks further progress. A few flat stones jut from the water providing a precarious set of stepping stones. Several underground springs feed the pool, which never runs dry. The dragon enjoys bathing in the pool, and signs of something large emerging from the water are easily visible in the surrounding soft sand.

## LAIR DRESSING 



1. Piles of gleaming white bones lie amid the lair's shifting sands. Some of the bones are clearly of desert animals— camels, hyenas and the like. Others are obviously human. Many are splintered and crushed; some are fused together.
2. A suspiciously dragon-shaped depression in the sand hints at the size of the lair's inhabitant(s). Perhaps the lair's resident recently rested here.
3. A small, jagged shard of blue scale lies half-buried amid gently shifting sands. The scale clearly came from a dragon, but because it is a fragment of a larger scale, it is impossible to accurately determine the dragon's size.
4. Gouge marks in the walls show where the dragon has sharpened its claws. Canny characters can use the marks to gauge the dragon's size.
5. A large mottled red stain on the floor shows where someone or something bled long ago. The stain is large —easily ten-foot in diameter.
6. The remains of a gnoll raiding party lie scattered about the area. The party comprised a half-dozen individuals; their scorched and burnt remains, and their melted, burnt or fused equipment, provide mute testimony to the potency of the dragon's breath weapon.
7. A confusing mess of large, clawed footprints in the sand covering the floor show where the dragon has come and gone. The most recent tracks lead away from the party.
8. A three-foot natural step divides the area in two; wind-blown sand has piled up against it, forming an almost five-foot-wide drift.
9. Faded words, daubed onto the wall in dried blood, read, “Your doom awaits. Flee if you can. Go no further.”
10. A narrow, half-foot wide crack cuts through the ceiling. A thin curtain of fine, dry sand sporadically sifts down from above obscuring what lies beyond. Consequently, the fine sand covering this area's floor is deeper than elsewhere in the lair.
11. A mangled and broken steel shield lies discarded on the floor. A single draconic fang pierces the shield at the epicentre of the damage.
12. The mouldering skeleton of some unfortunate explorer stands transfixed on a spear driven up through its groin. The spear's tip nestles in the deceased's skull. The dead explorer still seems to have most of his equipment. (If the dragon can create magical traps this is a perfect place to set one.) 

## DRAGON DRESSING: DISTINGUISHING MARKS 



1. A vivid scar, surrounded by malformed scales, runs from the dragon's forehead down between its eyes.
2. The scales on the dragon's belly are a beautiful light blue colour—akin to the cloudless desert sky.
3. Blue dragons have a single massive horn atop their head; this dragon's horn is missing its tip.
4. The dragon's scales are beautiful deep blue; desert winds and sand have scoured them completely smooth.
5. Several ragged holes pierce the dragon's bat-like wings; the holes create a high-pitch whistling sound when the dragon flaps its wings.
6. The dragon's protruding fangs are sharp and curved, although it is missing two fangs from its underbite.
7. Most of the dragon's scales are coloured a deep iridescent azure; a patch under its chin is of a deep indigo hue—perhaps this is a draconic birthmark or a family trait?
8. A large iron bolt, shot from a heavy crossbow, protrudes from the dragon's left shoulder. The wound is an old one, and the dragon's scales have regrown in a ragged fashion about the old injury. 





## MINOR SIGHTS, SOUNDS & EVENTS 



1. The heavy, pungent stench of ozone hangs in the turgid air. The smell is strongest near the floor. In areas with good airflow, the stench is noticeably fainter.
2. A light wind blows through the lair, whipping up small dust devils from the floor that twist, turn and dance before dissipating. This could be a singular event, or it could happen on a cycle—as wind enters the cavern through any number of cracks and crevices.
3. The sound of rocks tumbling to the ground comes from deeper into the lair. Alternatively, this sound could come from the lair's entrance. Paranoid characters might fear they have been trapped inside by the rockfall.
4. Outside, the wind whines about the lair's entrance like a living, breathing creature, obscuring the characters' tracks and making hearing difficult.
5. A faint hum and crackle of electricity in the air permeate the area. Worryingly, the phenomena's point of origin is difficult to identify.
6. A half-dozen columns of pale light pierce the gloom. They emerge from small holes in the ceiling. As the sun passes overhead the shafts of light move and then fade before the sunlight pierces other nearby holes.
7. A deep thunderous roar sounds from deeper inside the lair. The lair's strange acoustic properties cause the sound to echo for a few seconds before it fades away.
8. Sand sifts down through cracks in the ceiling, lightly dusting the characters' heads and shoulders. Unlucky characters get sand in their eyes.
9. Shadows move on the ceiling at the limit of the party's lights. (The party has disturbed a small colony of bats.) If the characters continue onwards, the bats take flight, swarm and flee. The flutter of their wings echoes through the lair— perhaps alerting the dragon lurking beyond.
10. A deep chuckle—redolent with menace and anticipation— echoes through the lair. Perhaps t h e dragon knows the characters have invaded its home and is amused by their pathetic attempts to surprise it.
11. The least perceptive character begins to feel the party is being watched from some unknown, hidden place. Wherever the party goes in the lair, the feeling persists. If the characters retreat before facing the dragon, they can't shake the feeling for the rest of the day— even when they camp for the night.
12. Small cracks crisscross the floor. Faint wisps of warm steam rise from the cracks. As the characters approach, the volume of steam seems to increase. (This effect is a natural phenomenon and follows a set pattern—the characters' arrival here is nothing more than a coincidence.) 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WHAT' S THE DRAGON DOING? 



1. The dragon is sleeping after a large meal. It is unprepared for battle and has cast no defensive spells (except those with particularly long durations).
2. The dragon is shamming sleep and may be very aware of the intruders in its lair. In this instance, it has prepared for battle (including casting defensive spells).
3. The dragon is rolling on its back, to scratch an itch, among its treasure hoard.
4. The dragon is admiring one of its choicest treasures and muttering to itself.
5. The dragon is just finishing a light snack of “camel and rider”. Blood and gore cover the ground; luckily for the characters, it eats away from its hoard—blood-drenched treasure is so difficult to clean, sort and sell.
6. The dragon is away hunting.
7. The dragon is away from its lair but returns shortly after the characters reach its hoard.
8. The dragon is conversing with a captive humanoid of the opposite sex. It is deep into a conversation about courting rituals and initially does not notice the intruders. (Either design a captive NPC or have the dragon slay the unfortunate in the first round of combat.) 





## HOARD TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. A small sandstone statuette depicts a desert deity revered by local nomads. Its glimmering blue eyes are tiny sapphires.
2. An ornate leather saddle decorated with beautiful etchings of seemingly endless desert dunes. Dried blood cakes the saddle's underside.
3. A shredded backpack lies under a pile of coins. A pocket-sized, leather-bound book lies within. The book is the diary of Armdel Jeral a wizard of growing skill obsessed with finding a certain ancient buried necropolis said to lie hidden deep in the desert. The journal stops abruptly but could hold enough to whet the characters' appetite for further adventure.
4. A drawstring velvet bag holds an ivory and jet chessboard along with a mahogany box containing matching pieces.
5. An ornate two-handed scimitar with a beautiful wavelike pattern running along its blade rests in a plain, worn leather scabbard. The scimitar's handle is well worn, and the weapon is in excellent condition.
6. Three tightly wound bolts of silk (blue, red and white) fill a leather sack.
7. A keg of fine white wine. The keg lid is slightly loose, and only half the wine remains.
8. This eerily lifelike stone carving of a man's head is missing its jaw, and the nose has been snapped off. (This could be the remains of a petrified adventurer).
9. A book cover crafted from some kind of thick, heatresistant leather (a chimera's hide). Unfortunately, the book's contents have long since been lost.
10. Large sections of this faded map are missing. The map's centrepiece is a large bay. A mountain looms over the bay. A name—Gloamhold—is emblazoned above the mountain in large letters.
11. A small cache of thick, square silver coins. Each has a hole in the middle.
12. A large cast-iron cauldron holds some of the dragon's more valuable coinage.
13. Decorations of cavorting water nymphs decorate the lid of this small iron-bound coffer. The coffer is locked.
14. A small worn brass lamp lies forgotten on its side, halfburied in the sand.
15. A tightly bound bale wrapped in thick canvas holds a great mass of packed leaves—tea.
16. Tied shut with a strip of red leather, this worn leather wallet holds a collection of fine quills and other writing materials. Two of the quills are of high enough quality to be used in scribing magical scrolls.
17. A pouch holds a small collection of highly-polished shells. Several of the shells have strange sigils daubed on them in purple ink.
18. A hunting horn, banded in iron, hangs from a short leather strap. Sand chokes the horn—it must be cleaned out before it will sound once again.
19. A small, plain coffer holds an iron incense burner along with three small packets of exotic-smelling leaves.
20. The bloody, shredded remains of a man's white shirt lie intertwined with the treasure. Perceptive characters notice the shirt still has several of its silver buttons—each stamped with the sigil of a noble family from a kingdom bordering the desert. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WORN TRINKETS 



1. This thick banded golden ring is worn as smooth as glass. The dragon wears it on the tip of one of its claws.
2. This dragon wears an ornate, but bent, silver torc as an armband of sorts. Several pale orange stones (carnelians) adorn the torc.
3. The dragon wears a single golden wire earring. Sized for a giant, the earring should be a delicate thing depicting a lidless eye, but it is surprisingly sturdy.
4. A sender black silk rope interwoven with delicate silver wire serves as a necklace of sorts for the dragon.
5. The dragon has three silver rings wedged onto various fangs. The rings are worn and pitted. Bits of the dragon's meals are wedged between the rings and their teeth.
6. A battered locket hangs from a stout silver chain around one of the dragon's claws. It contains a picture of a handsome halfling man wearing a battered gemencrusted helm.
7. An oversized iron ring forged in the shape of a snake eating its own tail. The ring is incredibly detailed and has resisted the general wear and tear of being worn by a dragon amazingly well. It is obviously old.
8. The dragon wears a silver crown that clearly once graced the forehead of a giant or similar creature. The crown's centrepiece is a rearing swan with its wings outstretched. Transparent red stones (spinels) serve as the swan's eyes. The dragon loves the crown and prefers to remove it before combat to keep it safe from harm. 





## HOARD DRESSING 



1. A wagon's splintered remains languish among the hoard. Missing one wheel, it lies on its side; the remains of the wagon's torn reins dangled lifeless, hinting at the draft animal's likely fate.
2. Five large plain earthen jugs stand together. Three are still stoppered while two are cracked and broken. The three intact pitchers hold water, but the water has spoiled over the years. Each jug bears its maker's mark on the base.
3. The remains of a pair of large, splintered barrels lie among the treasure. The insides are charred— deliberately—and once held brandy.
4. The shattered shards of a once beautiful crystal decanter lie under heavier treasures. Crushed by the weight of the treasures lying above, the glass shards lurk ready to catch the greedy, grasping hands of inattentive looters.
5. An ornately carved statue of a half-nude warrior posed in a heroic stance lies on its sand, half-buried by treasure and sand. The figure is in excellent condition, except it is missing its head (see #8, Treasures & Trinkets; this could be a petrified adventurer or nothing more than a statue).
6. A tightly wound, dusty arras stands on its end, leaning against a wall. Blackened by lightning—sadly damaged when the dragon slew its owner—it has minor value as a shelter or rug but none as a decorative wall hanging.
7. Carvings of nymphs cavorting in a pool of clear water decorate the sides of this small, portable stone font.
8. A tangled mass of gears, pieces of metal and shards of glass are the remains of a sophisticated mechanical clock. Several parts of the clock are missing; it is unrepairable without considerable expense and skill.
9. Four iron candlesticks and a score of long, thin candles fill a battered box. The box's lid is nailed shut, but the dragon has pried off one corner to see what lies within.
10. Of black iron, this large blacksmith's anvil stands upright amid the dragon's glimmering treasures. Three huge scratches mar one side of the anvil.
11. Buried in a small niche in the floor under the treasure lies a skeleton curled up into a foetal position. (Sadistically, the dragon buried alive a thief under the riches he had so coveted.)
12. One skeletal leg emerging from a worn, high brown leather boot.
13. The wreckage of a vanity screen painted with a beautiful desert scene lies amid the treasure. Splinters lurk to annoy the unwary looter.
14. The jagged shard of an ornate ivory comb lies amid the mass of coinage.
15. Scorched and burnt books lie scattered amid the treasures. Several have large bites taken out of them.
16. A pile of humanoid skeletons lies neatly stacked next to a wall. All the remains show signs of excessive violence.
17. Several boxes and barrels—all broken open—are piled together haphazardly. All contain food or drink; such contents are either now missing or mouldering.
18. A 20-foot-long length of good-quality rope lies coiled in an iron bucket. The rope is tied to the bucket's handle.
19. Two wagon wheels; one has the desiccated body of a gnoll chained to it. Investigations reveal the recentlydead gnoll probably died of thirst.
20. A packing box full of sawdust contains a dissembled chandelier. At first glance, the chandelier appears to be particularly fine—crafted from crystal. However, it is made of cheap glass (and the box is heavy and bulky). 





# DRAGON' S LAIR: GREEN DRAGON 



## LAIR FEATURES 



1. A thick curtain of roots grows down through the ceiling. In places, the growths are so thick they could obscure small hiding creatures such as very young dragons.
2. A root easily two-foot thick burrows through the ceiling and down into the floor. The root—the taproot of a large and ancient tree above—is so thick it could provide cover to those fighting or hiding nearby.
3. The earth and mud floor is churned up as if something large and powerful has been digging here. The resultant furrows and ridges of loose, damp soil create areas of difficult terrain.
4. Incongruously, a huge, albino oak tree grows in the middle of the chamber. Its lofty boughs spread wide and scrape the area's ceiling.
5. A wide sinkhole in the lair's ceiling emits light into the dragon's lair. Grass, saplings and bushes grow under the sinkhole upon a small hillock of soil, creating an oasis of underground woodland.
6. A large pool of deep, murky water fills much of the area. Tracks in the pool's muddy banks show where the dragon has slid into the water. Wily characters can study the tracks to get an idea of the dragon's size. Several narrow sunken fissures feed the pool and the dragon may use these fissures as a way to enter and exit its lair.
7. A stream winds its way through the dragon's lair before issuing forth from the lair's main entrance. The stream flows through a series of deep pools and down several small waterfalls before it reaches daylight. The sound of flowing water makes it hard to hear stealthy movement in the stream's vicinity. The stream's water tastes foul.
8. A deep, wide fissure cuts the lair in half. The jagged fissure is the result of some ancient earth movement and is 60-foot deep. The floor on the fissure's far side is tenfoot higher than the floor closer to the lair's entrance. Bones and decomposing bodies—the remains of the dragon's victims—choke the fissure and a faint charnel smell rises from its shadowy depths.
9. The dragon has covered the floor with deep soil and tried to plant various trees and shrubs to obscure several exits from the area. Many of the trees and shrubs are dying from lack of light, although voracious growths of mould and mushrooms grow throughout the g l o o m y , d y i n g “forest”.
10. A pile of splintered tree trunks lies in a precarious pile against one wall. The pile is ten-foot-high and comprises a dozen or so large trunks piled haphazardly. The dragon uses the pile to block a small cave mouth—within it keeps prisoners and snacks. The pile is unstable and could easily collapse if the wrong trunk is removed.
11. A worn pathway winds its way up a steep slope. Wooden stakes topped with grinning skulls along with torn, shredded pieces of animal carcasses and the like flank the trail. These macabre decorations are both a warning and declaration of the dragon's might.
12. The stark, fossilised denuded splintered trunks of an ancient buried forest thrust from the floor of the cave. Some of the trunks are little more than stumps while others rise to surprisingly loft heights.

## LAIR DRESSING 



1. A faint noxious scent hangs in the air throughout the lair.
2. The trunk of a splintered elm tree lies against a wall. Its white bark is torn and splintered. From a distance, the dirty white trunk looks like a gigantic bone.
3. An owlbear's disembowelled and partially eaten corpse lies scattered about the chamber. By the looks of things the owlbear was a huge specimen—but its size availed it naught when it encountered the green dragon.
4. Bats roost in the cave; the dragon tolerates them as they are a good early warning system for intruders entering its lair. Slippery piles of bat guano cover the floor.
5. A long length of corroded and pitted thick iron chain lies across the corridor; one end is still wrapped around a large skeletal arm, far bigger than a normal human's arm, that appears to have been yanked from its socket.
6. A large crossbow bolt—probably shot from a heavy crossbow, lies on the ground. The bolt's iron head is bent and buckled.
7. A large mound of rusting and rotting equipment sprawls across the floor; much of the gear shows signs of obvious violence and the faint smell of chlorine hangs in the air above the pile. Vermin—rats or even more dangerous creatures like rot grubs—might infest the pile, and attack anyone searching the mound for treasure.
8. The mouth to the next passageway looks—to paranoid characters—a bit like the gaping maw of some vast subterranean beast. Stalagmites and stalactites lend the appearance of teeth or fangs to the cave mouth.
9. A swath of malodorous bog covers a section of the lowlying cavern floor. A faint, rank smell issues forth from the bog which is fed by several small streams issuing from the cavern walls. Mushrooms grow in profusion at the edge of the bog and a faint covering of slightly luminescent green fungi gives the whole area an unwholesome glow.
10. The gutted carcass of a deer hangs from a small outcrop high up on one wall of the cavern. The deer's blood— which has begun to dry—coats the wall and floor below the carcass. Other swaths and splatters of blood on the walls and floor indicate the deer is not the first creature to be hung here. (Here the dragon hangs its choice of kills to ripen).
11. Greenish dust clings to the walls and floor of this area. Several strange and irregularly shaped “shadows” on one wall suggest the dragon once unleashed its foul poisonous breath here. Perhaps canny characters can use the size of the dusted area to estimate the range and scope of the dragon's fearsome breath weapon.
12. A swath of lichens, fungus and mushrooms grow in this dank cave. Several of the mushrooms have been ripped out of the floor—only jagged stumps remain. A character wise in the ways of nature can determine the mushrooms are of a sort which gives mild hallucinations to those ingesting them. (Perhaps the dragon is fond of the mushrooms and comes here to eat a few and dream strange dreams of ancient glimmering treasures and forgotten people). 

## DRAGON DRESSING: DISTINGUISHING MARKS 



1. The dragon's normally impressive nose horn is splintered and broken; only a jagged stump remains. Drool continually dribbles from the dragon's mouth.
2. The green dragon's wings have a network of browncoloured veins running throughout them which gives them the look of huge leaves.
3. The dragon's scales are a variety of shades of green; some are very light green while others are so dark green they could almost be black. This mottled effect is both unsettling and useful (for the dragon) as camouflage.
4. Blessed with a long, serpentine neck this green dragon moves its head back and forth in a hypnotic fashion before striking at its foes. Its eyes are close-set and surmounted with rows of tiny hornlets.
5. Dappled with patches of light and dark green, the dragon's wings look a little like a forest's canopy. The patches of dark green are more predominant toward the dragon's body.
6. This dragon has high nostrils and protruding teeth that curve downwards over its jaw. It also has a long and slender forked tongue. The pungent smell of chlorine gas surrounds the dragon. It speaks with a slight lisp.
7. Ragged holes pierce the dragon's left wing near its tip. When the dragon flies or flaps its wings, it emits a highpitched whistling sound through the holes, which makes it less stealthy than its brethren.
8. A high, dark green crest starts at the back of the dragon's head and continues all the way down its neck as it diminishes in height until it ends between the dragon's shoulder blades. 





## MINOR SIGHTS, SOUNDS & EVENTS 



1. The thick stench of chlorine gas hangs thickly in the area and is particularly bad in low-lying areas. Short characters—or those lying down—may even suffer laboured breathing.
2. A breeze passes gently through the cave bringing with it the slightly stronger smell of fetid gas; the party's nonmagical lights dance and flicker in the wind.
3. A small brown rat scuttles toward the party. The rat keeps close to the wall and ignores the characters unless they attack (in which case it flees).
4. A large, faded white chalk arrow daubed on the wall points further into the lair. Moss has begun to grow over the arrow, suggesting it has been here for some time.
5. The clatter of small falling rocks echoes through the cave from an unknown point. By the sounds of things, the rock fall was minor, and could not have blocked the party's escape route…
6. The sudden harsh cacophony of battle fills the air. It sounds like another band of explorers has already discovered the dragon. From the shouts and screams, the battle does not seem to be going well for the erstwhile dragon slayers. A sudden loud whooshing sound, some choked screams and a general clatter of armoured bodies hitting the floor seem to spell the end of the battle (or perhaps the one-sided massacre).
7. A thick cloud of acrid, green-tinged fog blows through the lair. Although it does not inflict damage on the characters, the fog stings their eyes and reduces visibility to around 20-foot.
8. A putrid smell hangs in the air. Characters investigating the smell discover a blood-smeared narrow crack in one wall which twists and turns for about 20-foot before reaching a small natural cave. Within the cave lies the decomposing remains of a forester or hunter. Characters investigating the corpse discover a badly lacerated leg was likely the cause of the man's death.
9. Loud screams accompanied by deep chuckling and chanting in the language of dragons reach the party's ears. The screams suddenly end and are replaced by the sound of rending and tearing flesh.
10. A faint earth tremor strikes the lair. Dust, dirt and gravel sift down from the ceiling onto the floor which vibrates as if struck repeatedly like a drum. Characters running or those unsteady on their feet may fall during the tremor, which lasts 30 seconds or so.
11. Greenish brown spider webs—impregnated with the dragon's poisonous gas—waft in the slight breeze; unhealthy-looking spiders scuttle about the webs.
12. At the party's approach, a small swarm of (harmless) bats takes light from their roosts on the ceiling and mill about. The bats flee the party's light, flying off in a random direction. (Their flight might alert the dragon to the presence of intruders). 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WHAT'S THE DRAGON DOING? 



1. The dragon is sleeping after a large meal. It is unprepared for battle and easier than normal to surprise.
2. The dragon is lazy and shamming sleep in the hopes of luring a tasty meal close enough to grab and eat without undue effort. If the party hesitate, the dragon even fakes snoring to lull them into a false sense of security.
3. The dragon is rolling around in its treasure hoard trying to itch a particularly hard-to-reach spot high up on its back. It is distracted and might not notice intruders.
4. The dragon has just finished dining on an owlbear and is preparing to gather up the creature's remains before throwing them out of the lair (or into whichever hole serves as its rubbish dump). Its first act when it spots intruders is to hurl the remains at the nearest interloper.
5. The dragon is sorting through its hoard in search of new trinkets to wear. It is distracted when the party arrives and is admiring several rings.
6. The dragon is contemplating some task or could be relearning its spells (if it is a spellcaster). Alternatively, the dragon pretends to be in some kind of trance to fool intruders into believing it is unaware of their presence.
7. The dragon is sharpening its claws on the trunk of a massive oak tree it has dragged into the lair.
8. The dragon is digging a hole in the floor. Perhaps it intends to hide a choice piece of treasure therein, or perhaps it is burying a body or some object too foul to keep in its hoard. 





## HOARD TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. A small ingot of pure adamantine fills an exquisite teak coffer. The coffer is locked, and unsurprisingly heavy. The key lies somewhere in the dragon's hoard.
2. A large tapestry depicting a mighty castle surrounded by woodland is tightly rolled up and kept off the floor by a bed of coins. The tapestry is large—10-foot by 20-foot when unfurled—and heavy.
3. A ledge about 12-foot off the floor holds a small collection of books. The books comprise several diaries and travel journals along with three minor spellbooks.
4. A bronze gong stands incongruously amid the other treasures; the gong's hammer hangs from a hook on its frame. The dragon likes the sound of the gong and sometimes flicks it with one claw—thus it sports several scratches and dents.
5. This half-finished marble statue depicts a beautiful dryad emerging from a mighty oak. The statue is over 12-foot tall, but only the uppermost eight feet have been completed. Chisel marks on the remainder show where the sculptor started his work; clearly he was interrupted.
6. Miraculously intact, this brass-rimmed hand-held magnifying glass fills a small custom-fit leather pouch. The initials G.G. are carved into his black-stained wooden handle.
7. Missing its shoulder strap this haversack seems to contain nothing but a mass of sodden paper and parchment. A diligent searcher, however, discovers the deeds to a ruined farmstead set at the edge of the woodland in which dwells the dragon.
8. A ring of tiny pearls decorates the handle of this ornate two-foot-long walking stick. Dried mud clings to the walking stick's other end, and a bloody handprint mars its shaft.
9. This small stone statuette of a lighthouse is incredibly detailed. A tiny magical light glimmers from the top of the carving—which may have additional magical powers (perhaps similar to an instant fortress).
10. Hanging from a fine silver chain this silver-plated whistle lets out a high-pitched shrieking sound when blown.
11. Painstakingly drawn onto a large, supple piece of parchment this map of the surrounding forest is breathtakingly detailed and shows several hitherto unknown potential adventure sites hidden deep in the woodland's unexplored reaches.
12. Carefully folded into a large, heavy sack, this waterproof tent is large enough for six people.
13. Three large matched jars hold a thick, foul-smelling liquid. This is embalming fluid. Each of the jars is marked with the elven symbol for death.
14. A bolt of red velvet fills a tightly drawn leather sack. An intricate knot protects the sack's contents.
15. A large collection of clean and highly polished shells fills this bulging pouch. Many of the shells are small, but two large white ones came from an oyster.
16. Seemingly near worthless this pewter jug may attract the attention of a suspicious treasure hunter. Scratching at the pewter—merely a false covering—reveals the silvery glimmer of platinum beneath!
17. This vial holds specially prepared ink suitable for the scribing of spells into a spellbook. The vial holds enough ink to scribe five levels of spells.
18. Closely packed fragrant leaves fill this small cedar wood box. The leaves are tea and are surprisingly valuable.
19. Sized for a dwarf, this heavy crossbow is inlaid with strips of beaten iron that glimmer in the light. The crossbow's string is interwoven with fine silver wire.
20. Beautiful flowing elven script spelling out the name “Wyrm Bane” decorates the blade of this slightly curved but perfectly balanced longsword. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WORN TRINKETS 



1. Three heavy glimmering golden rings hang from the dragon's left earlobe. They are a matched set.
2. A wide torc of beaten gold encircles the wrist of the dragon's left arm. The torc is a primitive thing with the look of ancient work about it.
3. The dragon wears a thick silver chain around its neck. The chain's intended use was to restrain a werewolf, but the dragon stole it from an unfortunate hunter who encountered much more than he bargained for. A carving of a moon decorates each of the chain's links.
4. The dragon wears a black choker set with a translucent red stone (a ruby) around its long, sinuous neck.
5. The dragon wears a wide leather belt as a headband and has set glittering black gems (large onyxes) in the belt's holes.
6. The dragon is blind in its left eye and wears a small dented steel buckler as an eye patch. The faded image of a blue-hued prancing pony decorates the old buckler.
7. The dragon wears a wide brown leather belt wrapped tightly around its left foreleg. It could wear it to protect an old injury, or the belt might have magic powers.
8. The dragon has recently fallen upon and destroyed a patrol of the local lord's men. It wears the patrol's bloody flag as a short cape. 





## HOARD DRESSING 



1. The splintered and torn remains of a set of bagpipes lie among the dragon's hoard. Dried blood coats the pipe's supple leather bag.
2. A splintered and rotten empty wagon lies on its side against one wall. It is missing all its wheels and is in terrible condition.
3. A smashed, once ornate, bronze lamp of exotic design lies among the hoard's coins. Foreign-looking runes of perhaps magical origin are etched into the lamp's squashed body.
4. The rotting torso of a muscular man fills a rent mail shirt. Dried gore covers the armour both inside and out.
5. A smashed and dented steel conical helmet filled with coins stands upside amid the hoard. The helmet once had leather ear flaps, but only one—bloodstained and shredded—remains.
6. Intricate carvings of a woodland scene replete with pixies, a unicorn and capering, half-naked elves decorate this chest. If the chest wasn't missing its bottom, it would be quite valuable.
7. The stump of a brass candlestick rises from the mass of coins and other valuables in the dragon's hoard. Elsewhere, amid the coins, lies the other part of the candlestick covered in dry melted black wax.
8. Deep claw marks in the floor bear mute witness to the dragon's scratching and sharpening of its claws. Several coins—and perhaps a few easily overlooked gems—are stubbornly wedged in the cracks.
9. A jagged, broken sword blade lurks among the hoard's glimmering treasures; distracted searchers could cut themselves badly on the once-fine weapon's stump.
10. Dirty water fills several small hollows in the floor; snapped bones emerge from the water of one such hollow, while the others might conceal small objects the dragon has lost track of over the years.
11. An iron scroll tube contains a heavily waterdamaged scroll. The scroll once held a powerful magic spell, but its magic has long since faded.
12. A pile of worn and dirty clothes lies next to the hoard. The dragon sometimes rests its weary head on this pillow of sorts. It also hides its choicest treasure deep in the pile.
13. Glimmering coins fill a black wrought iron bucket. A short length of rotting rope yet hangs from the bucket's bent handle.
14. A broken and splintered oak cask lies amid the hoard. The cask's interior is charred, and it once held fine brandy; the dragon has long since guzzled the spirit.
15. An as yet unopened plain chest holds a large selection of cheeses, several clay jugs filled with pickles and pickled onions and four large packets of smoked and salted beef. All are in excellent condition; the chest has clearly not been in the dragon's hoard long. A heraldic device on the chest's lid marks it as property of a local noble family.
16. A large, rusting cage lies on its side amid the hoard. The cage is about five-foot wide by ten-foot long and is the kind of cage used to transport prisoners by wagon. The jumbled, mouldering remains of three rag-clad individuals lie within.
17. This dragon likes to display its kills. Crude stakes— nothing more than sapling trunks thrust into the floor display the heads of its recent kills. A head tops each of the stakes (some of the heads may even still wear jewellery). Some stakes yet have their branches and the dragon has decorated these with various body parts.
18. A once fine, but now dented, tinderbox etched with the sigil of an exploding fireball lies among the other treasures. The tinderbox once belonged to Armas Nenonen a mage of minor repute who disappeared some years ago.
19. An iron coffer stands erect on one end among the other treasures. The dragon has scratched the coffer's lid, but the cunningly hidden locking mechanism has resisted its attempts to force entry. Something inside the heavy coffer rattles, if it is picked up.
20. This large beaten bronze sculpture seems to depict some kind of squatting headless toad-creature. It is an ugly, hateful thing best destroyed. 





# DRAGON' S LAIR: RED DRAGON 


## LAIR FEATURES 



1. Billowing clouds of hot steam drift from jagged cracks in the cavern floor. The steam hinders visibility and a gentle breeze blows it toward the lair's main entrance.
2. A pool of bubbling, boiling water divides the area in two. Fed from deep, super-heated springs the pool is a favourite place for the dragon to bathe. The pool is 20- foot deep and the water is scaldingly hot. Creatures in the pool without fire resistance or immunity are quickly boiled to death.
3. One section of the wall is partially melted. Clearly, it has been exposed to a sudden blast of incredible heat. A slag heap of cooled rock heaped in strange and weird shapes lies at the base of the wall. The top of a partially melted helmet sticks out of the slag heap but is impossible to remove without magic or mining tools. Diligent characters discover the remains of a warrior encased in the rock (perhaps still bearing some magical items of note).
4. Deep piles of splintered and scorched bones cover the floor to a depth of several feet. The vast amount of bones hinders land-based movement and provides macabre evidence of the dragon's rapacious hunger.
5. As #4 but the bone piles hide several deep holes in the floor. Such bone-filled pits are excellent places for baby dragons to lurk and play. Alternatively, a character accidentally stepping into such a hole quickly sinks to the bottom of an ever-shifting morass of bones. Escaping without help or magic is virtually impossible.
6. Lava seeps up from far below into this area through fissures in the floor before flowing away deeper into the lair. The air here is super-hot and heat shimmers obscure vision. Occasionally, pressure builds up in the chasms and lava then spurts forth like a fountain potentially deluging anyone unfortunate enough to be passing at that moment. Evidence of these occasional explosions—small patches of lava dripping from the ceiling are evident to those paying attention.
7. Suffocating clouds of hot steam stream from a wide vent in the floor. The steam is so dense it blocks all vision and anyone without fire resistance or immunity lingering in the cloud experiences trouble breathing. Characters in the steam must hold their breath or start to suffocate.
8. A great shard of black rock shot through with vivid red veins of some other mineral thrusts upwards through the floor. Easily 20-foot in diameter the rock literally pulsates with heat. The air near the stone is scorchingly hot and anyone touching the rock without magical protection is horribly burnt. (At this point, the boundary between the Prime Material and Elemental Plane of Fire is particularly weak; the rock is a shard of elemental stone that has somehow pierced the barrier between worlds. Skilled spellcasters may be able to carve a piece of the rock away for use in crafting certain fire-based magical items).
9. A veritable river of magma oozes through the caverns. Bubbling up from some deep repository, it flows sluggishly through the cave system out into the world. In several places, the river cuts caverns in twain forming a dangerous barrier to cross. (The profusion of lava and the resultant heat is the main reason the dragon chose this cave as its own and it loves bathing in the molten rock).
10. Geysers of hot mud dot several sections of the cave system. The geysers explode every now and then showering the surroundings in scorching hot mud. The muffled thumps of these explosions are audible through much of the rest of the caves. Thick, slippery mud covers the walls, floors and ceiling in the geysers' vicinity.
11. The broken skeleton of a dragon lies among the rubble and ruin of an old battle. Chunks are missing from the walls, gouges in the floor show where claws struck stone and so on. The dragon's vertebrae at the base of its neck are shattered; this was likely the killing blow although many of its bones show signs of extreme violence.
12. In the distant past, the dragon's lair was one large cavern in which fire giants built a great hall. A deluge of lava buried much of the giants' home; here and there, ancient stonework—huge, cunning fitted unmortared stone blocks—emerge from the walls, floor and even ceiling.

## LAIR DRESSING 



1. The air is particularly hot. So intolerable is it that anyone without resistance or immunity to fire starts sweating profusely. Explorers lingering in the vicinity too long suffer from heatstroke and extreme dehydration.
2. A cracked, partially crushed skeleton of a giant lies draped over an upthrust jagged rock. Evidently, something incredibly strong attacked the giant. Perceptive characters notice the skeleton shows no sign of fire damage.
3. A flap of burnt and blackened flesh is stuck to the wall at the end of a large smear of dried blood.
4. A swath of fused and broken stone comprises the floor. In the centre of the devastation lies the sooty outline of a humanoid figure its arms outstretched over its head.
5. The floor is so hot the characters can feel the heat through their shoes. In places, the leather of the shoes almost sticks to the floor such is the heat radiating from the stone.
6. Soot, flakes of scorched bone and other burnt, but unidentifiable, things cover everything in the area. Amid the ruin lie burnt and melted weapons, pieces of armour and other destroyed adventuring gear. From the volume of remains, it seems a fair-sized party met their end here.
7. A single bent scarlet scale the size of a buckler is wedged into a small fissure in the wall. The scale glimmers enticingly in the party's lights.
8. A wide fissure pierces one blackened, scorched wall. Within, perceptive characters make out the tell-tale glimmer of metal. Investigation reveals a skeleton yet covered in bits of burnt, decomposing flesh wedged into the fissure. All around the unfortunate, the stone is blackened, burnt and—in places—partially melted.
9. A rudimentary carving—perhaps done by the dragon with a claw—of a five-headed dragon decorates the floor. The five-headed dragon is depicted rearing back with all its mouths gaping wide.
10. Six grinning skulls glower down at intruders from a high ledge cut into the stone above the entrance to a tunnel leading deeper into the lair. Of the skulls, four appear to be from giants while the remaining two seem draconic. (If the dragon has a familiar or another tiny servant this is a good place for it to be hiding and keeping a watch out for intruders).
11. Pools of bubbling water fill gouges in the floor. The water is boiling hot—heated by geothermal activity below. the dragon has placed some near worthless treasures (see “Hoard Dressing”) in the pools to entice foolish or greedy explorers to risk severe burns to retrieve the objects.
12. Ripples of smoothed stone—stone melted by intense heat before cooling—comprise the cavern floor. A line of footprints—clearly the dragon's—mar the otherwise wave-like patterns on the floor. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: DISTINGUISHING MARKS 



1. A vivid scar runs down the dragon's snout from a spot roughly between its eyes. Two jet-black curled horns protrude from the back of the creature's head.
2. Small red and black horns festoon the dragon's cheeks and lower jaw. The stench of sulphur and burnt flesh hangs in the air about the dragon.
3. This dragon's eyes literally burn with lust or avarice—small flames leap about its irises as it surveys its foes. Brighter, fiercer flames dance about its nostrils and mouth.
4. Ragged holes pockmark the dragon's long, scarlet wings. Wisps of smoke and flame emerge from its nostrils.
5. With a particularly long, sinuous neck and swept-back straight horns this dragon has a distinctive profile.
6. One of the dragon's mottled black and red horns is as straight as a spear while the other curves dramatically upwards away from its head. Both horns are flecked with patches of white.
7. Only a ragged stump remains of the dragon's left ear; jagged teeth marks are visible in the remaining portion. From the looks of things the creature that tore away the ear had massive fangs.
8. Most of the dragon's teeth are jagged stumps but its horns are massive bone white affairs curving high above its head. Heat and the stench of smoke and brimstone radiate from the dragon in waves. 





## MINOR SIGHTS, SOUNDS & EVENTS 



1. The pungent smell of burnt flesh, wood and something else hangs heavily in the air.
2. A distant roaring akin to a far-off powerful wind echoes through the air. The sound comes from deeper into the lair and subsides as quickly as it began.
3. A bestial roar shatters the quiet. Whatever is making the sound could be angry or in pain, but it is hard to tell as the roaring quickly tails away into silence.
4. A jet of (harmless) hot steam bursts from a narrow fissure in the floor catching the character stepping over the crack by surprise. This can be nothing more than a minor occurrence or could be foreshadowing for a larger, more dangerous burst of scalding steam (perhaps #1 or #7 on “Lair Features”).
5. Disturbed by a sudden gust of wind, clouds of billowing ash and soot swirl around the party; when the wind subsides the characters are coated in grey dust; it gets everywhere—including in their eyes, ears and mouths.
6. The loud, harsh clatter of falling rocks sounds from elsewhere in the lair.
7. It is particularly hot in this area. The turgid, close air seems to have an oppressive heat to it that saps energy and vitality from any who linger in the area for more than a few minutes.
8. Macabre decorations festoon the walls. Here, the decomposing mangled remains of the dragon's slain enemies hang from ledges and outcrops. As the characters observe the scene, the sinews in one of the bodies finally give way and the two pieces fall to the ground with a disturbing, wet double “splat” sound.
9. Two glimmering lights—at about a human's head height —appear at the extent of the party's lights. The lights are shards of glassy rock set into the wall, although paranoid adventurers may initially think they are the dragon's eyes.
10. A deep, throaty chuckle redolent with evil and malice echoes through the lair.
11. Without warning, the cavern begins to violently shake, and small pieces of rock begin to fall from the ceiling. Some characters could lose their balance and stumble or fall. After a few seconds, the minor earthquake dies away.
12. Suddenly the heat in the area climbs to near-furnace levels. Jets of flame burst from a nearby passageway or fissure. This could be nothing more than an outpouring of flame from a volcanic vent or the dragon could be playing with its fiery breath—unaware the characters are near. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WHAT' S THE DRAGON DOING? 



1. The dragon is sleeping after a large meal of roast elf. It is unprepared for battle and furious to discover intruders in its lair.
2. The dragon is slowly roasting two human corpses transfixed on a long steel-shafted spear. The stench of burning flesh and the crackle of flame provides the party with some clue to what they will discover before seeing the dragon.
3. The dragon is faking sleep and is expecting trouble (either it has noticed the intruders or its sixth sense has alerted it to impending danger). It has already cast any longduration protective spells it knows.
4. The dragon is happily sorting through its hoard, examining its most beloved treasures. It is muttering and chuckling to itself when the characters arrive.
5. The dragon has just finished torturing and eviscerating a captive. As the characters arrive, it tosses aside the limp corpse and licks the unfortunate's blood from its claws.
6. The dragon is stalking about its lair in search of one of its treasures that it has just discovered is missing. It is muttering loudly about thieves and what it will do to the thief when it captures him.
7. The dragon is rubbing its scaly body up against a rocky protrusion in one wall and moaning with pleasure as it scratches a hard-to-get-at itch.
8. The dragon is a devout worshipper of Tiamat. When the characters arrive, the dragon is praying to his dark mistress in hopes of gaining some unspeakable boon. Thus, he sees the intruders as a test (or perhaps a gift) sent by Tiamat herself! 





## HOARD TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. Of blackened steel, this thick, heavy two-handed sword sized for a giant is almost ten feet long. Nowhere is the weapon's scabbard evident. Similarly whatever was wrapped around the sword's handle is gone making the weapon harder to wield.
2. Small blobs of precious intermingled metals—gold, silver and platinum—lie throughout the hoard. (These were created by the dragon's breath dripping onto the hoard and melting whatever they landed on).
3. Set with a red spinel in its pommel, this longsword— although covered in dried blood—yet retains its sharp edge. An inscription on the blade reads, “For His Everlasting Glory”.
4. This golden statuette represents a hideous squatting toad-like creature with tentacles. In places, the statuette is worn—suggesting it is a relic of some bygone age.
5. This pendant of an ant transfixed in a lump of amber hangs from a simple leather thong. The leather is surprisingly resistant to fire and flame; a hidden elemental power could lurk within the pendant.
6. This raven-shaped brooch is carved from a chunk of obsidian. It glimmers evilly in the light and two tiny flecks of ruby serve as the bird's eyes.
7. Of cast iron, this skull symbol hangs from a thin leather thong. Dried blood covers the skull, but a small secret compartment inside could hide a small potion vial or similar treasure.
8. With beautiful carvings of cresting waves and birds wheeling above a small sailing ship this engraved ivory tusk is an object of rare beauty.
9. Carved from a single piece of stained wood, this teetering tower has a distinct list to the left.
10. Containing pungent perfume, this small iron vial fits into the handle of a small silver mirror.
11. Contained in a small velvet bag this ivory hairbrush and comb set is inlaid with mother of pearl.
12. Beautifully wrought angelic figures overlook this six-foottall silver mirror.
13. This well-worn leather saddle with matching saddlebags lies among the treasures. Miscellaneous travelling gear fills the bags (although a small precious treasure could also lie within).
14. Set with tiny pieces of cut glass (or perhaps diamonds) this black leather choker is sized for a human or elf. It is missing its clasp but is easily repaired.
15. Oversized and thick of base this golden candelabra lies on its side. Dried wax covers its base.
16. With its cover decorated with a single lidless eye sigil, this weighty and thick tome is a spellbook. It could be the dragon's or it could have belonged to a wizard who fell in battle against the wyrm.
17. Filled with a travelogue, several maps of the surrounding area and three quills and two cracked and empty vials of ink this leather satchel has a black and blue stain on its bottom.
18. Wholly of silver construct, this delicate mirror is missing its glass, shards of which lurk among the surrounding treasures.
19. Six fragile clay pots containing alchemist's fire fill a bulging leather belt pouch.
20. This open-faced helmet of shining steel wrought with etched gold- and silver-filled wave-like patterns rests upside in the hoard and is filled with coins and gems. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WORN TRINKETS 



1. A silver necklace set with a gleaming red ruby hangs around the dragon's neck.
2. Several gold and platinum coins glimmer from the dragon's underbelly—the coins are pressed into the gaps between the dragon's scales to create a shimmering effect.
3. The dragon wears three thick golden rings on the claws of its left forearm. The rings are sized for giants and have giantish runes speaking of kingship and power etched into their bands.
4. The dragon wears an ornate silver and gold necklace set with various geometrically-shaped charms as a bracelet. The bracelet softly tinkles, when the dragon moves.
5. The dragon has bathed in molten gold, which has cooled and solidified all over its body; this gives the dragon a mottled gold and red hue. (Some observers may even conclude the dragon is a golden construct!)
6. The dragon wears an orange signet ring on one of its claws; taken from a questing member of a royal family centuries ago it is much sought after by the noblewoman's descendants. The ring's sigil comprises crossed longswords over a crown.
7. A pendant—a golden chain set with a glimmering blue sapphire—hangs around the dragon's neck. The sapphire is large, flawless and shines with an inner radiance.
8. The dragon is missing an eye. In its place, it has jammed a large glittering deep blue stone (a spinel). The stone glimmers and gives the dragon a sinister, but slightly comical, appearance—about which it is highly sensitive. 





## HOARD DRESSING 



1. The blackened shards of a particularly fine set of full plate armour are scattered throughout the hoard. The large pieces show signs of being gouged or cut open (so the dragon could get at the tasty snack inside).
2. The dismembered, mouldering remains of animals and humanoids lie throughout the hoard. Many of the corpses show signs of teeth marks and all are horribly burnt; clearly, the dragon has eaten well.
3. Incongruously, a blackened wrought iron cage stands amid the glittering treasures of the dragon's hoard. Scraps of burnt flesh and fragments of burnt clothes are yet stuck to the cage's thick iron bars.
4. A broken pick handle is wedged into a fissure in the floor; the pick head is nowhere to be found.
5. A large wooden chest, banded with thick strips of iron, stands half-buried among the hoard. The dragon uses the chest to hold some of the treasures it covets the most. If the battle goes badly, the dragon tries to grab the chest and fly away.
6. A ledge overlooking the treasure hoard holds the severed heads of scores of individuals; these are folk who have tried to loot the dragon's hoard and failed. The dragon has placed their heads here so the thieves can stare down for all eternity of the treasures they so coveted.
7. The shards of a shattered crystal ball lie in the ruins of a torn backpack. Parts of the backpack are bleached white as if stained by some unwholesome liquid.
8. A torn and scorched war banner hangs limply from the remains of a splintered staff. The remains of the scarlet banner depict a rearing swan outlined with silver thread.
9. A massive rent in the front of this ordinary set of chainmail renders the armour useless (and impossible to don without risk of serious injury).
10. Three shards of a beautifully carved white oak staff lie scattered amid the hoard. The wood bears carvings of runes of power—particularly those dealing with magical healing and the like.
11. Blood covers this studded leather dog collar sized for a gigantic hound (or perhaps a tiger).
12. A swarm of rats infest the hoard, growing fat on the dragon's leavings. The dragon catches and kills all it sees, but the rats live in small fissures in the rock and so some alway survive the dragon's predations.
13. A teetering pile of broken and scorched armour stands amid the hoard. The pile is a sculpture of sorts—the dragon enjoys seeing how high it can make the pile before it collapses.
14. Several choice items in the hoard lie together on a pile of furs and other soft fabrics.
15. An 18-foot length of partially melted chain hangs from a rocky outcrop in one wall. The chain is thick—it looks strong enough to perhaps ensnare a dragon!
16. A cracked and broken warhammer head lies on its side amid the other treasures. Nearby lies its handle's charcoaled remains.
17. A roughly 20-foot-diameter steep-sided pit is gouged out of the floor. Its bottom and sides are blackened and cracked as if having been subjected to repeated high temperatures. Fragments of bone lie at the bottom amid ash and soot. (Here, the dragon cooks its meals alive).
18. This twisted and shattered lantern looks like it exploded from within—its body looks like it has been peeled outwards by some powerful force.
19. The decapitated, charred corpse of a huge black bear lies atop a pile of bones; the pile comprises the remains of many animals and humanoids. Maggots and fleas infest the bear's corpse.
20. The skeletal remains of another dragon the same size as the hoard's owner lie where the creature fell; mounded treasures fill the beast's splintered ribcage. Glimmering gems fill the dead dragon's eye sockets. 





# DRAGON' S LAIR: WHITE DRAGON 







## LAIR FEATURES 



1. A dense field of ice stalactites hangs from the ceiling like the shining fangs of some gigantic creature. Some are so immense they almost reach the floor and can provide limited cover. Weird, ever-shifting shadows, created by the party's lights, cluster thickly among the stalactites.
2. The floor is of dense, hard-packed ice covered with a light dusting of snow. Consequently, the ground is incredibly slippery. Unwary explorers could slip and fall.
3. As #3 above except the floor slopes steeply down to another area—or perhaps even a precipitous drop into a crevasse. Characters slipping and falling slide into this other area with potentially fatal consequences.
4. The floor is nothing more than an ice bridge of varying thickness stretching over a chasm. Some sections are thick and easily support a character. Other areas—by accident or design of the dragon—are thinner and may collapse when walked upon. Characters falling through the ice end up in the area below, likely taking falling damage and becoming trapped in a slippery prison.
5. The shattered remnants of several large stalactites litter the ground, creating areas of rubble difficult to pass through. Other large stalactites hang from the ceiling. Perceptive characters notice cracks running through several of the stalactites. They are unstable, and if subjected to loud noises or fire magic collapse into the chamber below.
6. A large part of the ceiling has collapsed, partially blocking the way ahead with a pile of ice and snow. Climbing over the tumbled ten-foot-high obstacle is difficult as the jagged shards of ice are slick and, in some cases, razor-sharp. The pile also blocks line of sight to what lies beyond.
7. A jagged crevasse cuts this area in twain. The crevasse is between ten- and 20-foot-wide and about 40-foot-deep. A roiling, freezing mist obscures what lies at the bottom. Narrow passageways hidden by the mist could lead to a sub-level or provide refuge from the large, savage dragon lairing in the upper caverns.
8. A rambling pile of frozen bones forms the leavings of the dragon's meals. A cursory search of the frozen mass turns up huge bones (from frost giants) as well as other splintered remains from unidentifiable sources.
9. A multitude of slender, razor-sharp icicles hangs from the ceiling almost reaching the floor. The glistening icicles cluster thickly together creating a series of small maze-like passages for explorers to traverse. One wide avenue of splintered and broken icicles shows where something—in all likelihood the dragon—passed by.
10. Large boulders emerge from the ice floor and walls of this area giving it a strange, studded appearance. Carried here by the ice, the misshapen boulders form a series of makeshift stepping stones. Some are quite small while others are the size of a wagon. All are frozen into immobility. Several rocks also emerge from the ceiling—melting the ice around the stones causes them to plummet to the ground, with potentially fatal consequences for anything beneath them.
11. Huge ice sculptures of astonishing complexity and skill loom out at the characters from one high wall. The sculptures depict a white dragon hunting and killing a variety of creatures and humanoids. The sculptures flank a tunnel leading further into the lair. Paranoid characters may assume the sculptures are part of some kind of trap or are animate guardians that will activate when intruders get too close.
12. The ice forming the floor is so pure and unmarred that it is completely transparent. In fact, at first glance, a distracted explorer may believe the floor is actually somewhat lower—a level of hard-packed opaque ice about 15 feet down. (If the dragon is particularly devious it could have dug some pits out of the ice into which the characters could blunder.)

## LAIR DRESSING 



1. Faint footsteps of a booted, human-sized individual are visible in the soft snow. The footsteps lead deeper into the lair; they do not return.
2. The large, clawed footsteps of a dragon are clearly visible in the compacted snow. Canny characters can use the footprints to estimate the size of the dragon that made them.
3. The air is particularly cold. Ice crystals form on and around the characters' noses and mouths as well as in their eyebrows. It is so cold here, that it takes the characters' breath away.
4. A faint mist covers the floor to around ankle depth. The mist does not overly obscure vision. Perceptive characters notice the mist seems to be issuing slowly from somewhere deeper into the lair.
5. A faint shadow in the ice alerts the characters to something vaguely man-sized entombed in the frozen wall. If the characters hack the wall down, they discovered the frozen, disembowelled body of a human. (Hacking the wall down takes several minutes and makes a fair bit of noise, which might alert nearby lair inhabitants).
6. Great gouge marks in the snow and ice show where something large and powerful has scrapped and torn at the wall and floors.
7. A single ten-foot-wide ice pillar sprouts from the floor linking it to the ceiling. The ice is opaque and incredibly hard—compacted as it is by the vast weight of the ceiling pressing down from above.
8. A pool of water once lay here, but it has long since frozen creating a patch of incredibly slippery floor. The ice is slightly opaque and the characters can see the indistinct entombed forms of several creatures within. The ice is thick and easily supports the party's weight.
9. In this portion of the lair, the rippled ceiling ice is incredibly pure and clear. Thus, some small amount of light filters down from above giving the ice a beautiful—and unexpected—bluish hue. Consequently, the illumination is brighter here than in the rest of the lair.
10. A large snowdrift fills part of this area. Higher than a man is tall, the snowdrift serves as the dragon's larder—the frozen corpses of several creatures lie inside awaiting the dragon's attention.
11. A slab of rock emerges from the frozen floor, providing cover from what lies beyond. Deep gouges mar the rock's surface.
12. A network of minute cracks and fissures honeycomb the floor and part of one wall. The cracks are not dangerous —yet—and are just a result of the surrounding snow and ice moving and shifting. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: DISTINGUISHING MARKS 



1. The dragon has a livid, red scar running down its snout. The wound is old and has not healed well. Several of its bottom teeth are broken and jagged.
2. The dragon's scales are incredibly white and unmarred by any markings, scars or other discolouring. The scales glimmer in strong illumination creating a nimbus of dazzling light around the creature.
3. The dragon's scales are not completely white; its underbelly is mottled grey and white. The scales running up the underside of its neck are mostly grey.
4. Missing one talon from its back left foot, the dragon favours its right when moving about on the ground. It has a short, slender neck.
5. The dragon has a small and sharp beak on its nose and a slender, almost graceful chin. A few of the scales on its throat have a slight blueish tinge.
6. An impressive pure white crest tops the dragon's head, and the tips of its wings have a faint pink tinge.
7. The dragon has strangely coloured eyes—one is red while the other is a pure, cobalt blue. Both burn with a feral intensity when the dragon gazes upon foe or food (which is normally the same thing).
8. A large, ragged hole pierces the dragon's left wing, near its powerfully muscled thigh. 





## MINOR SIGHTS, SOUNDS & EVENTS 



1. Cracking sounds emanate from the ceiling and walls as the ice moves and shifts. The noise is ongoing, but not a warning of imminent structural collapse.
2. A shard of ice breaks free from the ceiling and plummets to the ground, barely missing one of the characters.
3. A high-pitched whistling—the sound of the wind passing through many small cracks and crevices in the ice—fills the air. It also grows slightly colder while the whistling sounds, which may worry paranoid characters.
4. Shreds of mist cling to the cold floor. As the wind sweeps through the area, the mist leaps and coils like a living thing into strange, eldritch shapes reminiscent of snakes, or perhaps even ghosts, before settling back to the floor.
5. Faint howling from outside penetrates the lair. Some characters might think the howling to be nothing more than the wind, others might identify it as the calls of a pack of hunting bears or—perhaps—the faint call of the dragon returning to its lair.
6. A sudden wind blows through the area, whipping up the soft, uncompacted snow blanketing the floor. The snow flurry swirls about the characters for a few moments before settling back to the ground.
7. Shadows play and dance deep in the ice wall. The effect is caused by the sun and clouds scudding through the air high above the lair. The dancing shadows speed up— or slow down—depending on the wind's speed.
8. A faint sobbing—or perhaps a mewling—reaches the party's ears. A few minutes later a horribly mauled frost giant child crawls into sight. The child has left a smeared blood trail on the icy floor—a trail that leads back to the hungry dragon.
9. As the party advances, several ominous cracks sound from under the ice beneath their feet. Although they may fear the floor is unstable, nothing untoward happens. Alternatively, after the cracking sound stops, the floor gives way beneath the characters' feet, but the chasm below the floor is only about five-foot-deep; the characters escape any real injury, but must still climb out of the hole.
10. From somewhere deeper in the lair the characters hear a deep whooshing sound followed by a deep chuckle redolent with evil, malevolence and sadistic humour.
11. With only the briefest of warnings a large chunk of the wall behind the characters cracks and falls away. It hits the floor and explodes pelting the party—and the surrounding area—with snow and shards of ice. The collapse causes no damage to the party, but paranoid characters might suspect some kind of trap.
12. Through some strange trick of the light, part of the wall ahead is both slightly transparent and reflective. Because of the lair's unique characteristics, a faint reflection of the dragon appears in the wall. At first glance, it could appear the dragon is a ghostly figure. Unfortunately, if the characters are carrying lights the reflections are twoway and the dragon might spot the party approaching unless it is asleep or distracted. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WHAT' S THE DRAGON DOING? 



1. The dragon is sleeping after a large meal of yeti. (The remains lie scattered nearby). It is unprepared for battle and has cast no defensive spells (except those with particularly long durations).
2. The dragon is shamming sleep and may be aware of intruders in its lair. In this instance, it has made preparations for battle (including casting defensive spells and so on).
3. The dragon is rolling on its back, to scratch an itch, among its frozen treasures.
4. The dragon is admiring one of its choicest treasures and muttering to itself.
5. The dragon is just finishing a light snack of yeti. Blood and gore cover the ground; luckily for the characters, it eats away from its hoard as blood-drenched treasure is so difficult to clean, sort and sell.
6. The dragon is away hunting.
7. The dragon is away from its lair but returns, dragging a dead frost giant, shortly after the characters reach its unattended hoard.
8. The dragon is using its claws to scratch a design into the ice walls of its lair. The design is comprehensive and covers much of the walls. Anyone damaging the walls with a fire spell gains the dragon's particular ire. 





## HOARD TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. A ten-gallon wooden barrel has been staved in on one side. The liquid inside—fine brandy—was frozen by the intense cold of the dragon's breath and has formed a spilt puddle by the barrel. The frozen puddle of expensive brandy is stuck to the barrel making retrieving this treasure tricky.
2. A gigantic white winter wolf fur cloak—once belonging to a frost giant—lies draped over a portion of the hoard. The fur is incredibly soft and keeps the wearer warm in all but the coldest climes.
3. A ripped and torn belt pouch lies amid the snow and ice. Only perceptive characters—or those searching very, very carefully—realise some of the ice crystals in the pouch are in fact small, unblemished diamonds.
4. A beautifully forged battleaxe is stuck to the nearby treasures by a thick layer of frost. The weapon's head has a fine coating of frozen blood—the dragon's—on the blade. One severed—frozen—hand clasps the axe's haft.
5. Two carefully bound piles of wolf and bear pelts roughly the size of a human's torso lie close to one another. The piles are bulky, but the pelts are of excellent quality.
6. Wrapped in a strip of faded, blue silk this small statuette depicts a hunched yeti-like figure. Strangely the creature has a human's face twisted into a sadistic grimace. (The statuette is a representation of a local nature spirit—the capricious god of the surrounding mountains).
7. Some kind of foul-smelling grease that has somehow resisted the freezing temperatures in the dragon's lair fills this large pot. (The grease is melted whale blubber and has many uses including being used to protect creatures from hypothermia's deadly effects).
8. This bronze and silver armband is sized for a human and has been cunningly worked to depict a writhing dragon— its open jaw ending just above the wearer's wrist.
9. A pair of heavy silver candelabras. One yet holds a stub of a thick red candle.
10. This cracked crystal decanter has a silver stopper cleverly wrought into the shape of a rearing swan's head. Magic can repair the crystal.
11. A silver unholy symbol of a skull missing its jaw.
12. A long bronze-edged hunting horn complete with strap. The horn creates a long, undulating sound when blown.
13. This small iron statuette depicts a slender tower— perhaps a wizard's tower or a lighthouse.
14. This ripped front cover of a large book—perhaps a spellbook or grimoire—has a secret slip pocket; perhaps a small treasure such as a scroll lies within.
15. A small sack, tightly tied with string, contains 20 packets of salt and 20 packets of pepper along with enough beef jerky to sustain a traveller for one week.
16. A wolf fur-edged cowl tops this voluminous scarlet cloak. The cloak has fangs for buttons and four inner pockets.
17. A monocle attached to a slender golden chain lies in a padded box small enough to fit into a pocket or pouch.
18. A pair of soft, velvet slippers lie one inside the other under some coins. Anyone wearing such shoes in the mountains must have been insane—or protected by powerful magic.
19. The stopper of this empty cast iron vial is attached by a fine silver chain to the vial's neck. The runes for magic and healing are picked out on the vial in silver to match the stopper's slender chain.
20. This slender belt comprises nothing but hundreds of small iron rings. 

## DRAGON DRESSING: WORN TRINKETS 



1. The dragon wears a golden torc as an armband or bracelet (depending on the dragon's size).
2. Several small glimmering rubies are wedged between the scales around the dragon's eyes. The glimmer red flecks of light give the dragon a fell, demonic aspect.
3. The dragon wears a necklace comprising several interlinked silver and gold necklaces sized for humans. A forgotten locket hangs from the smallest necklace.
4. A single, fat golden ring—its surface thick with glistening hoarfrost—decorates the tip of the dragon's crest.
5. Several gold rings lurk on the tips of the dragon's claws. The rings are firmly wedged on, but every time the dragon rolls a natural 1 for an attack roll one snaps and falls off.
6. The dragon has wrapped a bloodstained polar bear fur cloak around its right forearm. It likes the rusty red splash of colour on the cloak and is eager to refresh it.
7. The dragon wears a gigantic giant skull as a helmet of sorts. The skull gives the dragon a slightly ridiculous, comic appearance, but the skull—which once belonged to its most hated enemy—has great sentimental value to the beast.
8. The dragon wears a small, cracked and frozen metal box around its neck on a thick iron chain. The key for the metal box—actually a lich's phylactery—is long lost. Within the box, strips of leather crafted from human skin name the lich—Ningal Kutha; if the phylactery is smashed, the lich is immediately aware of its destruction—and who broke it. 





## HOARD DRESSING 



1. The disembowelled frozen corpse of a yeti lies among the treasure. Some of the dragon's treasure has slipped into the creature's chest cavity.
2. The splintered bones of a long-dead explorer lies intermingled among the dragon's hoard. The unfortunate's skull still wears the shattered remains of a once fine iron helmet decorated with fantastic etchings of mountains and valleys. Sadly, due to the helmet's condition, it is essentially worthless (and difficult to remove).
3. A deeply dented and scratched metal shield far too large for a human to use effectively lies amid the hoard. The dragon has filled the concave shield with coins.
4. The treasures lie around a large shard of cloudy ice carved—crudely—into a rough image of a dragon rearing up on its hind legs. It looks like the ice sculpture was never finished—perhaps the carver did not survive the experience because the dragon was displeased with his efforts.
5. A bulging backpack is partly obscured by a snowdrift. Sadly, it contains nothing more than a wadded-up blanket and three days of frozen rations.
6. A small wooden coffer stands amid the treasures; its broken, upturned lid lies nearby.
7. The splintered remains of a small open-backed cart lie on their side. Bits of the cart are scattered throughout the treasure pile.
8. A backpack holds a tightly wound coil of knotted 40 ft. long rope. Two snowshoes are strapped to the outside of the pack.
9. The remains of a wooden sledge with once-beautifully carved runners depicting such strange creatures as walruses and the like. Scraps of straps hang from the sledge, but whatever they secured is gone (and probably somewhere in the dragon's hoard or belly.)
10. A harpoon, missing the bottom three-foot of its shaft, is impaled in the ice. Slender rope still hangs from the harpoon's blade.
11. Two pairs of wooden snow goggles sized for particularly small—perhaps halfling—heads.
12. The shreds of a wide leather belt are still attached to a bronze belt buckle shaped like a gaping demon's mouth.
13. Shreds of ribbon in bright colours such as yellow, orange, red and blue are scattered throughout the hoard.
14. A once fine, now shattered bronze long-necked ewer etched with an engraved mountain scene is missing its bottom. Nothing but snow and ice remain within.
15. This lacquered hardwood travel case once held a lute (the shattered lute lies elsewhere in the hoard). The case's catch is also missing.
16. A stout oaken travel staff worn at one end and decorated with a half-dozen (frozen) eagle feathers tied to the other with slender, near-invisible string.
17. A pile of frozen bodies lies stacked against one wall. All are of humans (or whatever humanoid race dwells in the surrounding locality) and are naked. Nearby, covered in drifting snow lies their shredded clothes and so on.
18. A length of pitted and corroded chain almost 20-foot long lies intertwined among the hoard.
19. A healer's bag, minus its shoulder strap, full of clean, unused bandages, jars of frozen unguents and a small surgical kit.
20. A single scrap of parchment lies under a light dusting of snow; the only marking on the parchment is a faintly traced pentagram picked out in red and black ink. 





# FAILED THIEVISH DOINGS 







## FAILING TO FIND ANYTHING 



1. You see nothing out of the ordinary and hear nothing but the laboured breathing of your companions and the creak of their equipment.
2. A slight breeze plays across your face, but you can't make out where it comes from.
3. Some of the nearby shadows seem slightly deeper than they should be.
4. You thought you heard a whispered conversation for just a moment, but all is now quiet.
5. As you search the area, a shiver runs down your spine. Is someone watching you?
6. You suddenly feel warm, as if you had exerted yourself for some time. Perhaps it's just the stress of the adventure?
7. Dust—caught in the light—swirls and shimmers in the air creating patterns that form and reform.
8. A faint odour—perhaps sweat or damp—hangs in the air, but you cannot identify its source.
9. Your heart pounds loudly in your chest, and the roar of blood fills your ears. However, in the area, you detect nothing of interest.
10. You detect nothing of interest, but something feels “wrong.” Perhaps it's paranoia, or your sixth sense warning of a lurking, danger...
11. You listen intently for the slightest sound, but suddenly one of your companions coughs loudly and ruins your concentration.
12. Although you detect no apparent dangers in the immediate area, a prickly feeling between your shoulder blades just won't go away...
13. A sudden breath of wind sighs through the area—it almost sounds like the dungeon itself is breathing...
14. Odd marks in the dust suggest something disturbed it, but it is unclear what did the disturbing.
15. Spider webs cluster thickly in one corner. As you watch, the whole mass seems to pulsate and move as if disturbed by air moving through some hidden niche or crack.
16. As you observe the area, a cold shiver briefly grips your body. As quickly as it comes, it goes—what caused it is impossible to say with any certainty.
17. Sweat drips down your forehead and into your eyes, momentarily blurring your vision. No matter, there is nothing to see here...
18. Your footsteps echo strangely in this place—as if the area was larger than it first appears.
19. You don't hear anything out of the ordinary except for a faint ringing sound. You wait a few moments, but it doesn't go away.
20. The area seems safe, but—bizarrely—your nose starts to tingle, and you have the overwhelming urge to scratch it. 





## FAILING TO FIND A TRAP 



1. The floor doesn't seem completely flat. Several parts are slightly higher than the surrounding areas.
2. Dust on the floor is thicker in some places than in others.
3. A gentle breeze caresses your face. You can't determine its source.
4. The mortar in the walls is old and crumbling. In some places, it has wholly disintegrated, leaving gaps between the stones.
5. The floor at one point seems to be slightly concave, and the stones look somewhat damp.
6. Your (torch, lantern or other) light casts strange shadows on the walls as if they are not as flat as they first appeared.
7. The area seems slightly colder than you'd expect.
8. The area seems slightly warmer than you'd expect.
9. There is a faint, acrid smell in the air.
10. You are pretty sure you heard t h e f a i n t g r i ndi n g o r groaning of stone on stone.
11. The air is perfectly still—it's as if the dungeon itself is holding its breath…waiting for you to make a mistake.
12. The area seems safe, but you thought you heard a faint clicking for a moment. It's stopped now. It was probably nothing.
13. The ceiling looks a little odd. Perhaps it's not built properly, but you swear it's sloping down toward one side of the room.
14. There's a fair amount of dust and small pieces of stone lying against one wall.
15. The faint smell of smoke hangs in the air.
16. Several sections of the walls have soot stains reminiscent of that left by torches set in sconces. However, there are no sconces present anywhere in the room.
17. Scratches on the floor show something large and heavy was dragged through here. Oddly, the marks stop roughly halfway across the floor.
18. In three spots, water drips from the ceiling onto the floor. None of the resultant puddles seems very large, suggesting the water is draining away somehow.
19. Faint growths of mould on the (floor, wall or ceiling) hint at an organised pattern of sorts unlikely to occur in nature. (The pattern could suggest a hidden portal, trapdoor, pit or a magic sigil.)
20. The proportions of the whole chamber look wrong. Some pieces of architecture—protrusions and niches— seem to serve no purpose whatsoever, and the ceiling looks suspiciously low. 





## FAILING TO PICK POCKETS 



1. You slip your hand into the mark's pocket and search for some small treasure. You cut your hand on something jagged within and suffer 1 point of damage.
2. You miss the mark's pouch and instead slip your hand into his trousers (or her skirt). This—unsurprisingly— immediately alerts them to your attempt!
3. As you slip your hand into your mark's pouch, they move unexpectedly. Your hand gets snagged in the pouch, and you are dragged along with them.
4. You successfully cut the pouch from your mark's belt but fail to actually catch the pouch as it falls. It clatters to the ground, immediately alerting them to your attempt.
5. Just as you slip your hand into the mark's pouch they also reach into it. Embarrassingly (and potentially disastrously), you end up holding hands.
6. You try to slip your hand into your mark's pouch but miss your target. Instead, you get your hand tangled up in the victim's belt, which is a problem as you are now effectively entangled with your victim.
7. As your hand drifts toward the mark's pouch, you step on something slippery and fall to your knees in front of your target. You try to break your fall by grabbing the mark's belt, but this does nothing but alerts them to your larcenous doings.
8. Picking pockets is hard. As you reach your hand forth you start to daydream about what you'll lift. Sadly, this distracts you, and you miss the target instead slipping your hand into his shirt (or her dress). When you feel warm flesh beneath your hands, you realise your mistake, but it is too late...
9. Walking and pickpocketing at the same time is tricky. While you manage to get your hand into the mark's pouch and extract some shiny goodies, you pull your hand out too quickly. Consequently, what you filched flies from your hand, arches through the air and lands with a clatter on the floor.
10. You fail to extract anything from your victim's pouch. Even worse, as you remove your hand, one of your rings —or perhaps a bracelet—snags on the leather material and falls into the depths of the pouch. 

## UNWELCOME DISCOVERIES 



1. The pouch holds something warm and furry—a small pet. As you realise this, the rat or mouse bites you and begins to squeak loudly!
2. A small and broken rusty knife lurks in the mark's pouch on which you cut yourself. You take 1 point of damage and start bleeding profusely.
3. You extract a small worn stone idol from the pouch. Examination reveals the humanoid/octopus hybrid thing to be squatting on a throne. Crafted from some kind of black rock, the idol is a hateful thing.
4. You have extracted a small piece of folded parchment tied with a piece of red string. (This is a trap, and the parchment is protected by an explosive runes spell. Reading the parchment sets off the trap.)
5. The pouch holds nothing but an old, dirty rag. The rag is infested with fleas; if the character keeps it they are soon infested with the fleas.
6. The pouch held the mark's lunch—a large crusty meat pasty—which you have just crushed in your clumsy pick pocket attempt. Remnants of the pasty fill the pouch and coat your hand with bits of pastry, chunks of meat, gravy and the like. (This makes it difficult for the thief to use that hand to hold a weapon, climb a wall and so on until they have cleaned it off.)
7. The pouch holds a sputum-covered rag the mark has been using as a handkerchief. Your hand is now covered in slimy gunk.
8. Among a handful of silver and copper coins, you have liberated a single gold coin from your mark. On examination, you discover the coin is extremely worn and looks extremely old, as if it has passed through many hands over many long years. A faint inscription on one side shows a stepped ziggurat in relief.
9. A tangle of string fills the mark's pouch. As you extract it, it starts to unravel. As you move away it unravels but remains connected to something in the pouch's depths.
10. You have stolen a hip flask full of brandy—or at least that's what the heady smell coming from the flask suggests! (In fact, this brandy is poisoned, and the mark intended to use it in a murder. If the character drinks from the flask, they may fall foul of the poison.) 





## FAILING TO PICK A LOCK 



1. As you carefully explore the lock's inner mechanism, your pick snaps in half and jams the lock. You've now got two problems—how you'll extract the broken pick, and (afterwards) how you'll pick the lock!
2. Your hands are sweaty. As you jiggle the lock, your pick slips from your fingers and slides through the lock into the room beyond!
3. You slip and badly bend your pick, making it useless for future lock picking attempts.
4. You sneeze violently and stab yourself in the forehead with the lock pick. You take 1 point of damage.
5. Your lock picking makes an inordinate amount of noise as you grind your pick in the lock. Anything in the room beyond probably knows you are coming.
6. There is an ominous clunk from within the lock, and your pick is stuck! It seems you've managed to break the lock's internal mechanism...
7. Your hands are sweaty. As you pick the lock you slip and stab the pick into the door. (Unless the character pulls the lock pick out carefully, it is bent and ruined.)
8. Doubt assails you. Picking locks is hard, and you are crap at it. Until you successfully pick a lock, you suffer a penalty on all such checks.
9. Your hands are sweaty. The lock pick drops out of your hand, hits the floor and rolls under the door.
10. Sweat drips down your forehead. Without thinking, you wipe it away with your hand forgetting you are holding a lockpick. You stab yourself in the eye and take two points of damage. 











# FAIRS & FESTIVALS 



1. Wisp Mote Festival: Vendors selling candies and sweetmeats line the avenues during the day. At night, strange blue motes of light rain down from the skies as the townsfolk dance, drink and sing in the streets. The annual celebration commemorates an ancient pact forged between the fey and the town's founders. At the stroke of midnight, the wisps of light freeze in mid-air and all manner of fey creatures appear in the streets to join the celebration.
2. Carnival of Kuligar: The citizens have gathered in a clearing just outside town. Strange mechanical contraptions whirl and clank within a clearing alongside several large pavilion tents. A barker calls to anyone and everyone to join him on a fantastical journey. A few brave families can be heard laughing from large compartments as they are tossed about by the whirling and swinging motions of the strange machine; each machine bears a phrase that declares it to be a numbered trial of an individual named Kuligar.
3. Festival of Scarlet Flames: Alchemical lamps burning a deep red hue cast the streets in a sinister nocturnal light. Several hooting and laughing townsfolk with faces painted red and garbed in dark robes battle each other with wooden swords. Observation reveals several of the robed combatants have a dark red sigil embroidered on the backs of their garments. These marked individuals appear to be passing a coin between them as they battle through the streets.
4. Feast of the Troll King: A carved wooden troll, ringed by tables brimming with food, sits in the central plaza. Citizens moving through the square take bits of food, leaving some on a plate in front of the monstrous carving. The festival lasts for an entire week as locals regularly replenish the tables with food. Throughout each night, the food placed in front of the carven troll gradually disappears.
5. Day of Walking Memories: Every year, on the first day of autumn, the ghosts of those buried within the graveyard manifest over their graves. The townsfolk awaken at dawn to meet the spirits. Throughout the day, the living and deceased discuss events of the past year as well as what is to come. As the sun sets, the spirits return to their graves in a silent procession. Once all of the shades have vanished, the townsfolk hold a feast in the central square.
6. Wolf Hunt Jubilee: Bowyers and fletchers hock their wares in the town square. At the gates, men and women string their bows and examine their arrows. Next to the gate stands a scoreboard filled with names. The competition is a three-day event held once a year and open to anyone. The winner receives the Wolfbane Cloak, a symbol recognised throughout the region.
7. Festival of the Chimera's Crown: Trios of townsfolk tethered by a short length of rope wearing monstrous masks chase children through town. Stalls line the plaza handing out tiny leather pouches filled with flour citizens toss at the tethered trios to knock wooden crowns from their heads. Once all the crowns are removed, the town gathers in the square to commemorate the heroes who faced the legendary chimera.
8. Harrow's Fall Festival: At the centre of town, a welldressed cloth mannequin sits upon a wooden throne. During the day, citizens mockingly bow to the statue when they pass by. At dusk, celebrants bombard the mannequin with colourful dyes before it is paraded through the streets and eventually burned at a feast in front of the town's main church.
9. The Apprentice Games: Young townsfolk dressed in the garb of apprentice arcanists gather outside an old ruin just beyond the edge of town. An aged wizard waits at the ruin's entrance to signal the start of a race to collect a hidden orb. The apprentice who retrieves the orb is given a feast in their honour and is taught the ritual to summon a familiar.
10. Carnival of the Delve: An array of monstrously decorated tents and wagons outside town promise entertainment and lavish prizes to those daring the trials within. Each tent contains a complicated obstacle course with a different dungeon theme. After paying a small fee, participants finishing the course in a set amount of time receive a tiny chest of assorted baubles and knick-knacks as their prize. 





## MINOR EVENTS 



1. An amorous couple—paying no attention to anyone but themselves—blunder into the party. The pair are innocent of any sinister intent, but suspicious characters may suspect a pickpocketing attempt.
2. Laughing children rush through the crowds playing a wild game of tag. One child—desperate to not get caught—hurls herself through the legs of one of the party. An unwary or distracted character may be knocked to the ground by the sudden impact of a hurtling child.
3. Shouts and laughter coming from a nearby attraction or stall drift over the crowd. Whatever is going on over there, people are having a good time and more drift over to investigate the commotion.
4. Shouts of “Thief!” and “Pickpocket!” come from close by as a richly-clad merchant points an accusative finger at a small boy cowering against a stall. This could be a case of mistaken identity, or the boy could be a thief. The angry merchant seems intent on thrashing the child.
5. A juggler moves through the crowd plying his trade— keeping five whirling cudgels in the air. A drunk festivalgoer decides it would be hilarious to throw something at the juggler—an apple core, empty wine jack or something similar. Unsurprisingly, this distracts the juggler who drops his cudgels. A loud argument ensues.
6. Doing a roaring trade, a man (Ahti Hopea [LN male human]) moves through the crowd selling hot meat pies from his small handcart. Spotting the characters—and gambling they have coin to spare—he makes a beeline for the party. His tasty meat pies cost 5 cp each.
7. A stray dog trots through the crowd on the hunt for dropped food. It spies the remains of a dropped pie and darts forward to wolf it down. If the characters are eating, the dog follows them around and begs for scraps.
8. Three children walk through the crowd laughing and talking. Two are clearly trying to impress the third, and their boasts and jests become ever more outlandish.
9. A well-to-do couple wanders among the fair, enjoying the day. Their four children dart about laughing and joking with one another. Occasionally, one or another of the children demands a coin from their parents for a treat or visit to a stall. Laughing, their parents dispense the coins seemingly without a care in the world. Perceptive characters notice three thugs trail the family.
10. A tall, smiling man (Eerik Ihamuoto [LN male human]) wanders the crowd shouting in a deep, booming voice about the bargains to be had at Lauri's Cornucopia of Wonder (see #5 Stalls & Attractions overleaf).
11. A troubadour (Ari Kultimo [NG male human]) wanders the crowd strumming his lute and singing a happy, merry song. The man has a good, strong voice.
12. Two laughing drunks clutching jacks of ale, which they quaff from between bouts of intelligible singing, stagger through the crowd. Both are much the worse for wear and stink of booze. If they don't notice the party, they might stagger into the characters.
13. A young child (Kerttu Kalpio [young female human]) stands alone amid the crowds, crying. She has lost her parents and is scared. If a character hoists her onto their shoulders, one of her parents quickly spots her. They both rush over to reclaim their daughter and thank the characters profusely for their aid.
14. A noblewoman—or perhaps the wife of a wealthy merchant—glides through the crowd, trailed by two servants carrying a variety of boxes and bundles. A grizzled, stout bodyguard walks beside the noblewoman —his eyes constantly roving the crowd in search of threats. She has no time for social inferiors.
15. A ragged child (Jegor Nousia [CN male human thief 1]) approaches the characters and tries to talk them out of a few coins. He explains, he wants to have a good time with his friends, but his parents are too poor to spare any coin. He thickly lays on the emotional blackmail and is a persistent fellow. If it becomes obvious he is wasting his time, he loudly swears at the characters, wishes them bad luck and darts away into the crowd.
16. A balding, stocky man (Kössi Ora [N middle-aged male human]) pushes a handcart through the throng from which he sells jacks of red wine for 1 sp. The wine is thin and vinegary, but he knows much of what is going on— he could be a useful source of information for the characters. Kössi is a good way of introducing interesting rumours to the party.
17. Niilo Paaso (NE male human thief 2) wanders through the crowd wearing a ludicrously stereotyped wizard's outfit complete with stuffed pouches and a pointy hat. He has impressive sleight of hand skills which he uses to amaze children. While he does so, his accomplices Aili Ehtaro (NE female human thief 2) and Miro Slycaller (CN male halfling thief 3) pick distracted onlookers' pockets.
18. Birds soar overhead; occasionally, one or more swoops to the ground to gobble up some dropping morsel of food. If the birds get aggressive, they try to steal food from children's hands. Most of the birds are normal creatures, but a wizard's familiar could lurk in the flock for some unspecified purpose.
19. A sudden burst of rain sends festival-goers dashing for cover under trees and into tents. The downpour only lasts 20 minutes, and some of the undercover attractions do a roaring trade in the meantime.
20. An elderly couple totters through the crowd; three small dogs—little more than puppies—dart about their legs, playing happily and investigating everything. 





## STALLS & ATTRACTIONS 



1. KREETA' MASKS This stall sells a variety of colourful face masks from packed racks. Most masks depict particularly lurid caricatures of various creatures—orcs, dragons, goblins and the like—while a few also depict predatory animals such as hawks and wolves. The storekeeper, Kreeta Tuntia (NG female human), is a pleasant woman well-used to parting customers from their hard-earned coins. • For Sale: basic animal or monster mask 1 sp, detailed mask 3 sp, ornate dragon mask 1 gp.
2. ESOTERIC LODGE OF ALL KNOWLEDGE This tall, jet-black tent glowers over the market like a brooding giant. A sign driven into the ground nearby reads, “Esoteric Lodge of All Knowledge”, and the faint scent of incense wafts from within the tent. Inside, Sakarias Vaania (LN old male human wizard 4) tells fortunes. The floor is thickly carpeted, and esoteric symbols cover the tent's inner walls. A glowing brazier provides a faint light, and heady incense fills the air. • Services: basic divination 1 sp, fortune-telling 2 sp, spellcasting services 25 gp x spell level.
3. TRY YOUR LUCK Dozens of pitted wooden targets set at different heights and distances stand throughout this dimly lit tent. One end of the tent is open to customers but is blocked off by a wooden counter. Dozens of (poorly weighted) darts lie on the table. As potential customers approach, the wizened stall-keeper— Kylli Uro (CN old female human fighter 2)—challenges them to hit three targets to win a prize. • Services: three darts 5 cp, seven darts 1 sp. • Prizes: basic stuffed toy, jack of weak ale.
4. THE SQUARE Here, a whip-thin man stalks a roped-off square. The man (Torsten Kainu [LN middle-aged male human fighter 7]) brandishes two wooden rapiers and offers to fight anyone daring to step into the ring. The rules of the fight are simple: the first one to strike his opponent three times with his wooden rapier wins. Torsten is friendly and often fights mock battles with children (which he loses) if no serious customers dare the ring. His brawny son, Samppa (LN male human fighter 3), himself an accomplished fencer, collects entries fees and (rarely) dolls out prize money. When not working fairs and suchlike, Torsten hires himself out to noblemen and the like to train their children in the fine art of fencing. • Entry Fee: 5 sp. • Prize: 5 gp.
5. LAURI ' S CORNUCOPIA OF WONDER Two wagons, drawn up next to each other, form this makeshift stall. Here Lauri Saarelainen (CN male human) sells bric-a-brac, odds and ends and other bits and bobs he has bought from hard-up customers desperate to turn their assets into cold, hard coin. His carts hold an incredible array of objects. Organisation has wholly escaped Lauri, however, and everything is jumbled together—there is no rhythm or reason to the display. If the characters search through the jumble, they might find something of interest. If they do, roll on the table below to determine what they find:

SUBTABLE

1. This pair of well-shod boots with worn heels has a gash across one of its soles. Perceptive characters notice magical symbols pertaining to speed picked out in silver thread on the back of each shoe.
2. This dagger is more of a short sword—being almost 18- inches long. It has an oversized pommel, which can be unscrewed to reveal a hidden compartment big enough for a potion vial. The weapon needs sharpening and comes with a worn, serviceable sheath.
3. A strange stubby, prickly plant fills a battered clay pot. Knowledgeable characters recognise the plant as a cactus. How it got here remains a mystery as Lauri can recall virtually nothing about the seller. Hidden in the pot, beneath the dry earth, lies a forgotten trove of 3 pp.
4. This cracked silver hand mirror has traces of stone clinging to its handle. Disturbingly, the stone remnants seem to be patterned in a way similar to a hand's grip. The stone can be chipped off, but doing so scratches the mirror's handle.
5. Intricately carved, this wooden ship is missing its sails and rigging. Careful examination of the model reveals the means to attach lengths of fine string and small pieces of canvas to the model to fully depict a ship under full sail.
6. This small book is a travelogue; it is water stained and has several torn pages. As well as a traveller's general description of the lands he travelled through, it also has several hand-drawn maps of the surrounding region. The maps are not to scale but do show all large regional features and settlements. 





6. BLUE BOAR TAVERN Three sides of this vast, gaudy pavilion have been pulled back to create an open-air tavern. On all three sides, a stout ten-foot high stake driven deep into the ground holds a carved blue-faced boar akin to a ship's figurehead in size and style aloft. Upturned barrels set about the interior serve as makeshift tables about which gather a happy throng. The tavern's bar stands at one end of the tent; here, the crowd is deeper as many festival-goers try to get served. Harried servers push their way through the crowd carrying drinks to the various tables. The tavern's crowd is good-natured, but a small patrol of the watch loiter nearby to keep an eye on the revellers. • For Sale: mug of ale 4 cp, pitcher of wine 2 sp. Pekko Salme (NE male human fighter 3/rogue 3) owns and runs the Blue Boar Tavern, aided by his extended family. The family are travellers—always on the road to the next market day, festival or fair. Although he appears as a bluff, welcoming fellow, the Blue Boar tavern has a sinister side— Pekko is a black-hearted thief, murderer and kidnapper who uses the Blue Boar tavern as a cover to go about his sinister doings. Worse than that, his extended family have similar proclivities and the group prey on those who appear weak or vulnerable. Pekko is wary of tangling with adventurers and avoids any confrontations with such folk.
7. TIERA' S WANDERING PLAYERS This small travelling troupe of actors, bards and sundry stage performers wander the land and make their living performing certain plays and comedies to the masses. Typically found in towns and cities where the audience is plentiful, they sometimes perform at large festivals and fairs. Led by the charismatic Rusi Tiera (NG middle-aged male human), the group perform a series of short plays, sketches and other performances during the day. Many of their performances require fantastical costumes and relate epic tales of heroes of old. Most have no basis in reality, but the GM could insert rumours or legends of ancient events pertaining to upcoming adventures into the performances.
8. KYTENIAN' S PERFORMING BEARS Kytenian Pyloninn (NG male half-elf ranger 5) wanders from settlement to settlement with his two young trained bears. A consummate animal trainer, Kytenian has raised the pair since he found their mother dead in the woods amid a circle of slain orcs. The two juvenile bears—My and Solal—travel everywhere with Kytenian in his specially reinforced wagon. He is a friendly and popular man, and his charges are well-trained— something he shows off in a popular show which involves the bears fetching and carrying things, dancing—sometimes with people plucked from the crowd—and so on. Kytenian is also a trainer of animals for hire. A sign on his wagon proclaims him as such. If hired, he requires 1 gp a day as well as food and lodgings; to complete his duties, he needs somewhere quiet to train his new charge. He only works with natural animals—he wants no part in training potentially sentient monsters. • Angry Bear: A small boy in the crowd is in a mischievous mood. While Kytenian is distracted, the boy throws small sticks, peddles and anything else he can get his hands on at the bears. Eventually, one missile strikes Solal in the eye. The sudden pain sends the bear into a wild frenzy. Solal roars loudly and tries to get at his tormenter. Terrified, the crowd scatters. 





## COMPLICATIONS & OPPORTUNITIES 



1. A gang of pickpockets target the crowds. Well organised and aggressive, the gang moves through the revellers indiscriminately; they avoid obvious adventurers, but their activities do not long go unnoticed by their victims. As a general cry goes up, many commoners turn to the characters to “do something” about the “bandits” and “ne'er-do-wells”.
2. One of the many fair's entertainments comprises trained animals of a ferocious sort—wolves, bears or perhaps something even more exotic such as a mountain lion. During the performance, one of the animals gets loose and jumps into the crowd. Panic ensues as peasants rush to get away from the animal while its owner desperately tries to recapture it before the watch— or someone else—slays it.
3. Desperate, Inkeri Väinä (NG female human thief 2) a p p r o a c h e s t h e characters; she is a travelling troubadour but has fallen foul of a local thieves' guild or the like over a misunderstanding. While performing for the crowds she has noticed several unsavoury types watching her and has begun to fear for her safety. She asks the characters to escort her safely away from the fair. In thanks, she offers to compose a song in their honour. If this doesn't work, she knows several rumours and legends—one or more of which could propel the party into their next adventure.
4. As the day passes, progressive darker and more gloomy clouds gather over the festival. In mid-afternoon, the heavens open, and a deluge sends many festival-goers running for cover. The rain is so heavy, the ground quickly turns to mud, and the event is washed out. (This could be seen as an ill omen depending on the nature of the celebrations.)
5. A small group of local citizens doesn't believe the community should celebrate the event after which the festival is dedicated. Once the festivities are in full swing, they arrive and begin to be generally disruptive— shouting, getting in the way of festival-goers and so on. Tensions quickly rise, and before the watch arrives to control the situation, a brawl breaks out.
6. A sudden outbreaking of screaming heralds some dark event. Investigations reveal a murder has taken place—in broad daylight! As the watch arrive, several of the peasants accuse each other of the wicked act and confusion reigns. 





# FALLEN DWARVEN HOLD 



## DWARVEN HOLD DRESSING 



1. Dust and the bones of the fallen thickly cover the floor. Obviously, a great battle raged here. All the remains show signs of violent death. Nothing of value remains.
2. Dried rust-coloured stains cover the ornate wall carvings here. The stains—dried blood—obscure much of the cravings' details, which depict a craggy mountain range of epic proportions.
3. Deep, dusty cobwebs obscure the arched ceiling, creating areas of deep shadow. Disturbing the webs creates a billowing dust cloud that lasts for several minutes before the dust settles on the ground—and anything else (including explorers) in the area.
4. The shattered remains of a stout dwarven door choke the entrance to this area. Something impressively strong knocked down the door. Pieces of its intricate stone hinges yet remain attached to the door jam.
5. A small niche low down near the floor pierces one wall. A small slab of stone crafted to look like the wall lies discarded nearby. Within the niche lies a switch that is in the down position. There is no clue as to what mechanism or feature the switch operates.
6. Nine small niches about the size of a man's fist pierce a wall at about a dwarf's shoulder height. Stylised carvings —depicting rays of sunlight—radiate from each niche.
7. The once beautiful dwarven carvings decorating the walls are comprehensively defaced.
8. Carved into one wall, the words of a dwarven battle prayer speak of glory, duty and implacable hatred toward the clan's enemies.
9. A pile of mouldering, dusty bones lie in a heap before a doorway, suggesting someone made a stand within. Perceptive characters note many of the bones are crushed or broken—mute testimony to the savagery of the struggle once fought here.
10. The stone floor is chipped and damaged as if someone had tried to dig it up.
11. Dust covers much of the floor. A cracked stone basin juts from one wall, and water drips from within. Under the basin, the water has turned the dust into a thick, grey paste that glistens in the party's lights.
12. A cast-iron brazier lies on its side among the dust and mouldering detritus of the dwarf's fallen home. Scattered coal, along with an oversized wrought iron poker, lie about the brazier.
13. A dusty pyramid of dwarven skulls—perhaps a battle trophy or warning—dominates this chamber. Of the rest of the dwarves' remains, there is no sign.
14. A shallow channel—that once guided water to a hidden cistern—cuts across the floor. Rubble and debris fill the water's course; consequently, the surrounding floor is slick with moisture (and floods after rain).
15. The clan's sigil is carved into the rock above the next door the characters discover. (Investigations reveal the head-sized carving can be pushed inwards slightly; doing so operates the door's lock).
16. A small handcart lies overturned on the floor. The wood is soft; mushrooms and fungi grow over the remains. Nearby, the remnants of the cart's contents—clothes, food and so on—have mouldered away leaving nothing but a foul stain upon the stone.
17. An intruder's skeletal remains lie sprawled on the floor. No valuables remain, but a crossbow bolt is yet buried in the unfortunate's forehead.
18. A five-foot-wide hole pierces the floor. A chill breeze issues from the hole, which seems to be impossibly deep. Light sources dropped within quickly disappear.
19. Thick red-brown mould grows across the walls and floor. Observant characters notice an indistinct lump amid the decay has the same general shape as a skeleton.
20. Rusty and grimy iron chains running down one wall hang through a hole in the ceiling. They disappear into another hole in the floor. The chain is thick, although one loop at floor level is horribly twisted, which has stopped it from running into the hole. 





## WORKSHOP FEATURES & DRESSING 



1. A large anvil of blackened iron, forged in the shape of a clenched fist, stands in the middle of the floor. Bumps and dents—testimony to the service it has seen—cover the anvil's clenched fingers.
2. Shelves cut into the living rock fill one wall. Choked and cluttered with rubbish, broken tools and mouldering, unidentifiable things, they appear—at first glance—devoid of loot.
3. A broken hammer lies on the floor near the door. Nearby lies a skeletal dwarf his—or her—head caved in by one terrible blow.
4. A stone workbench juts from one wall. The bench is almost one-foot-thick; cunningly fashioned drawers pierce its side. Most have been pulled out and ransacked, but one remains tightly closed. Chip marks on the drawer front show where someone tried—and failed—to prise it open.
5. A fire pit topped with an iron smoke hood fills a corner of the chamber. Dusty coals fill the fire pit. Nearby, a stone bunker holds yet more coal ready to feed the long-dead flames.
6. An overlooked curled-up bloodstained parchment lying under other rubbish and detritus bears plans and sketches for the dwarf's next creation. The plans are intricate and ambitious—almost a work of art in their own right. They might even be worth something to someone in the same trade.
7. A small forge stands against one wall. Next to it, a once neatly stacked pile of seasoned wood is scattered across the floor. The wood is bone dry and burns fiercely. Perceptive characters notice one piece of wood is hollow and contains a slender silver necklace (worth 50 gp) wrapped in a strip of brown cloth.
8. Scattered broken tools cover the floor.
9. A wrought iron chandelier wreathed in magic light illuminates the workshop. Forged in the shape of a skeletal dragon in flight the chandelier is bulky and difficult to remove without damaging the dragon's outstretched wings.
10. The workshop's stone door is heavy and cumbersome. The workshop owner was clearly paranoid as the door has slots for two heavy bars on the inside. Two iron bars lean against the wall by the door. (This feature can make the workshop a safe place to rest). 

## DWARVEN STATUES 



1. A plate-clad dwarven warrior of stern visage stands with a warhammer grounded between his feet.
2. A plate-clad dwarf, replete with an impressive beard wearing an ornate helmet, stands with feet powerfully braced. He has a massive battleaxe raised above his head as if about to strike down a foe.
3. A dwarven woman stands with one hand outstretched in the universal gesture for “stop”, but a slight smile plays upon her face. She wears voluminous and ornate finely carved robes.
4. A dwarven man—clad in obvious clerical garb—kneels in a penitent pose. He holds both hands outstretched cupped into a bowl.
5. This carven orc warrior falls backwards arms outstretched. Eight crossbow bolts protrude from his chest. A grimace of pain and fear twists the orc's hideously ugly face.
6. This statue once depicted a dwarven warrior in his battle finery. However, the figure has fallen from its plinth at some point and lies smashed and scattered on the floor.
7. A plate-clad dwarf warrior stands on either side of a doorway. The warriors' raised spear tips meet above the door's arch. Both warriors wear ridiculously ornate horned helmets.
8. With a large warhammer raised high above his head this dwarf warrior—his face dominated by a beaming smile— stands seemingly ready to strike down anyone passing below his plinth.
9. This ten-foot-high statue—carved out of the same stone as the floor—depicts an impossibly large and ornately crafted two-headed dwarven axe.
10. An abnormally-coloured outcropping of rocky high up on one wall is carved to depict a large dragon bursting forth from the rock. The dragon's maw gapes wide to reveal dozens of sharp fangs. A crossbow bolt juts from one eye. 





## TEMPLE FEATURES 



1. Ornate carvings on the walls depict a procession of dwarves climbing through seemingly endless caverns. They show many women and children among the throng —which is probably a migration or holy pilgrimage.
2. Ornate, but lurid, carvings on the walls depict a great battle between dwarves and a horde of savage orcs. Many dead orcs lie at the dwarves' feet.
3. A statue of a powerfully built, stern-faced dwarven warrior stands on a low plinth. He wears ornate plate armour and carries an immense two-bladed waraxe across his chest. His finely plaited beard reaches almost to his waist.
4. Through much of the temple, the floor is flawlessly smooth—clearly through the work of devoted stonemasons. A few sections, though, are slightly worn— no doubt by the passage of countless dwarves over the long centuries.
5. Pillars carved to depict massive bulbous-headed maces hold aloft the roof. The head of each weapon blends into the ceiling. The columns are broad enough to obscure the sight of what lies beyond, and might even conceal hidden niches.
6. A stone coffin rests atop an ornate stone bier. Upon the coffin's lid, carved in blissful slumber, lies a dwarven warrior clad in beautiful plate armour. Dust lies thickly upon the coffin and bier. However, perceptive characters notice the warrior's hands are strangely bereft of dust.
7. Dusty tapestries hang from the walls. Dust lies so thickly upon them their designs are impossible to make out. Shaking the tapestries releases billowing clouds of dust. Once the dust clears, the characters can see lengthy dwarven prayers decorate the tapestries. The glimmer of metal reveals some of the lettering is picked out with gold and silver wire.
8. Orderly rows of dusty stone pews jut from the floor. The skeletal remains of several dwarves and many more of their enemies lie scattered among the pews.
9. Carved into the living rock of one wall the pipes of an enormous bagpipe easily four times the height of a dwarf now stand silent. Of the bagpipes bladder and blow stick only tattered, and scorched remnants remain.
10. Three immense ornate iron braziers stand overturned about the chamber. Magical light—that throws weird shadows across the chamber—still dances within. 

## MINOR DWARVEN TREASURES 



1. A plain golden band sized for a dwarf's finger. On the ring's inner surface, carved in tiny dwarven runes, is the name Kilisi Jarbek.
2. A bundle of almost impossibly thin silver wire rolled into a tight bundle snuggly fills a mouldering, nondescript leather pouch.
3. A set of four small perfectly smooth stone jars with tiny gemstone stoppers. The jars are sized to perhaps hold perfume or spices. A faint sweet scent lingers in one of the jars.
4. This heavy iron ring bears a crest depicting a crossed warhammer and battle-axe. Dried blood splatters the heavily scratched ring.
5. This thin sheet of stone, measuring about six inches to a side, bears an intricately carved portrait of a smiling dwarven man. He wears large hooped earrings.
6. A metal cover of beaten brass yet protects the scorched and slashed pages of a thick tome. Dwarven runes—The Passage of Days—are stamped into the brass.
7. This mouldering pair of dark brown thigh-high leather boots have metal toecaps. The boots' leather is worn and supple and sized to fit a male dwarf.
8. A deep grove runs down this dagger's blade to divert an enemy's blood away from the wielder's hand.
9. A heavy pair of iron knuckledusters fill a dusty, motheaten pouch. The knuckledusters—sized for a dwarf's hand—are in excellent condition.
10. This small stone bowl comes with a perfectly sized lid. Magical, heatless fire lurks within the bowl. Removing the lid allows it to shine forth with the radiance of a blazing torch.

## SIGNS OF PREVIOUS EXPLORATION 



1. A smear of charcoal on the wall shows where someone stubbed out a torch. Nearby, lies the discarded stub of said torch.
2. A shredded backpack rests on the floor. Dried blood coats the pack's back. Characters searching the pack's remains find a single dusty gold coin caught up in a fold of the fabric.
3. Footprints in the thick dust betray the presence of another explorer. A skilled tracker can interpret the tracks and realises whoever made them was sprinting at the time he or she made them.
4. Lichen and mould grow over a few scraps of mouldy food and a discarded water flask.
5. A glimmer of light from one wall catches a character's eye. Investigating, the character discovers a bent silver coin wedged into a tiny gap between two stone blocks.
6. A splintered javelin, its rusted head bent, lies abandoned against a wall.
7. Burnt scraps of wood arranged in a rough circle show where someone built a campfire. The detritus of a quick camp—crumbs of food and so on—are also in evidence.
8. Shards of glass from a broken wine bottle lie on the floor. Unwary explorers could stand on a large shard and suffer one point of damage.
9. An iron spike is hammered into this door's stone frame. The piton is impressively bent, but it's done its job—the heavy stone door still stands ajar.
10. A splintered pickaxe handle lies on the floor. Nearby, the pickaxe's blade juts from a narrow crack in one wall at about waist height. (Perhaps the previous adventurers discovered a secret niche but were disturbed before they could get it open). 



## TRIGGERED TRAPS 



1. An open pit pierces the floor. Within, impaled on slender stone spikes carved from the pit's floor, lie the skeletal remains of three intruders. One-foot-deep brackish water fills the pit, and its sides are slick with lichen.
2. A perfectly square stone block, fallen from the ceiling, partially blocks the corridor. A skeletal hand emerges from under the block—the rest of the unfortunate's remains lie crushed to dust beneath the stone.
3. Fallen rocks and debris choke a side passage, from floor to ceiling. Gritty dust lies thickly on the floor in front of the cave-in. Unexplored chambers could lie beyond, or the passageway could have been nothing more than a trap for the unwary.
4. A rusting iron ballista bolt as thick as a dwarf's forearm is buried deeply in one wall. Of what shot the bolt there is no sign, but cracks radiate out from the impact point for some considerable distance.
5. An iron portcullis blocks further progress. Thousands of tiny spikes stud the portcullis's bars in all directions making climbing a painful business.
6. Rusting iron spikes jut up from the floor through cleverly hidden holes. A reddish stain covers several of the spikes and the surrounding stone, but there is no sign of whoever triggered the trap.
7. A cracked stone door—surrounded by a dried bloodstain —lies flat on the floor in front of a false doorway. Nothing but a small niche, empty but for the trap's mechanism, lies beyond.
8. A swath of melted floor—centred on a tiny niche cut into the ceiling—bears mute testimony to some savage acidbased trap. Fragile shards of bone and other detritus lie scattered about the area.
9. A wickedly barbed spear protrudes from the floor. Transfixed by the spear, the skeletal remains of an intruder remain (mostly) standing upright. Pieces of bones and mouldering equipment lie scattered around the unfortunate. If touched, the skeletal remains collapse and clatter (loudly) to the floor.
10. A portion of the floor—reaching from wall to wall—has fallen away to reveal a steep smooth stone chute leading downwards to some unthinkable depth. A light source dropped down the chute quickly slides away out of sight. (The chute leads to an isolated level from which there is no escape for those unable to climb back up). 





# FANE OF EVIL 







## MAJOR FANE FEATURES 



1. Two large, vividly painted stone statues of devils or demons flank the fane's entrance. The beasts are depicted in the act of striking those entering the shrine. Beyond, a veritable forest of slender pillars holds aloft the ceiling. Carvings of lurid scenes of slaughter and sacrifice decorate each pillar.
2. Small iron candle sconces jut from the walls. Wrought to look like grinning skulls each sconce has a hinged lid— the skull's forehead opens—to enable the changing of the candle within. When lit, the candle's light flickers in the skull's eye sockets and gaping jaw.
3. Purple and red tapestries depicting disturbing geometric shapes hide the wall behind the altar. The tapestries hang in a peculiar, unsettling way; their folds hint at deeper, perhaps non-Euclidean, mysteries hidden in their decorative patterns.
4. Thick, viscous blood-like liquid oozes down the shrine's walls into deep channels running around the room which funnel the liquid into a central pool. (Iron in the rock is responsible for the water's blood-red hue).
5. Six 20-foot-deep pits pierce the chapel's floor. Each is barely five-foot square and is used to hold prisoners and sacrifices. Nearby, a ladder crafted from leg bones lies on the floor next to a wall.
6. Nauseating bas relief carvings of foul otherworldly creatures pursuing and killing humans in horribly graphic ways decorate the walls.
7. As #6 but perceptive characters discover a hidden niche opened by slipping a small blade into a jagged belly wound in one of the carved dying humans.
8. A three-panelled brass screen wrought into terrible scenes of devilry and suffering partitions off part of the room. The bulky screen weighs 200 lbs.
9. A huge statue depicting the fane's patron stands fully 20- foot high on a dais in a shadowy alcove. Large chunks of green gemstones (malachites) glimmer in the statue's eye sockets. A flaming brazier stands in front of the statue, cloaking it in shifting shadows.
10. A wrought-iron cage with jagged bars stands behind the altar; big enough for four humans (at a squeeze) the cage is where the priests keep their sacrifices. It reeks of despair and fear.
11. Yellowing bones fill deep precisely cut channels hacked into the floor. From above, it is obvious the channels form a gigantic, unholy symbol.
12. Complicated arrangements of bones—mostly leg, arm and rib bones along with many skulls—decorate the fane's walls. Stuck in place with some kind of adhesive, the bones come from hundreds of individuals.
13. Two pyramids of skulls—as high as a grown man's shoulders—flank the chapel's main entrance. Carefully stacked, the piles can be knocked over with a strong push. Doing so scatters the skulls across a wide area.
14. Two huge iron braziers filled with coal and other foul things belch noxious smoke into the air. Each brazier is large enough to hold two bodies. Black sludge, soot and fragments of bones around the braziers' bases hint at what is burnt within.
15. Some sections of the chapel's walls are crumbling as if being eaten away by something inside. (The horrible influence of the fane's lord is at work on the very fabric of the place). The stone crumbles at anything but the gentlest touch.
16. An oppressive gloom—the manifestation of all the evil acts committed herein—fills the shrine. Nonmagical light is only half as effective as normal. The gloom does not dissipate until the shrine has been reconsecrated to a good-aligned power.
17. Wrought iron cages—barely large enough for a human to crouch in—hang from the ceiling. Skeletons lie within most of the cages. A clever set of wheels and pulleys enable the raising and lowering of the cages.
18. A ten-foot-wide cleft in the rock pierces the floor and cuts the shrine in twain. A narrow stone span bridges the gap, and faint sounds drift up from below. Beyond the chasm, a thick black curtain, decorated with unsettling, otherworldly patterns, hangs from the ceiling all the way to the floor obscuring sight of what lies beyond.
19. The floor comprises dozens of gravestones stolen from nearby graveyards. The inscriptions on each are vandalised or effaced. Filled with burnt and splintered bones a six-foot-long, three-foot-wide and seven-foot deep hole in the floor may be nothing more than a bone pit. However, the bones could also hide a secret burial crypt or reliquary.
20. Alcoves pierce the walls. Inside each stands an upright sarcophagus with an ornately carved lid. Each sarcophagus holds the remains of a worshipper. Some might animate when the chapel is threatened. 





## MINOR SHRINE DRESSING 



1. A strange otherworldly smell of some kind of alien, unknown incense hangs in the air.
2. An old sarcophagus lid is set into the floor. The inscriptions on the lid are faded and indistinct. Prising up the lid is difficult—it has been mortared into place. (It might ward access to a hidden burial vault or merely have been used as an expedient repair.) Many cracks pierce the surrounding floor. A faint (cold or warm) breeze issues forth from their depths.
3. A faint, indistinct haze hangs in the air. Discarded purple robes lie on the floor.
4. Rusting chains and manacles hang from iron spikes driven deep into the walls.
5. A large battered bronze gong hangs from a stand set against a wall. A heavy hammer leans nearby.
6. Tall wrought iron candelabras standing about the room hold thick red candles.
7. Glowing coals fill several iron braziers set about the room. Each emits a cloying smell.
8. Ancient and worn copper and silver coins fill the deep cracks in one wall.
9. A smell akin to that of wet dogs hangs in the air.
10. Many tiny cracks pierce the walls, floor and ceiling.
11. A faint sobbing sound reaches the characters' ears.
12. Many iron nails pierce the floor. They form a trail of sorts leading towards the fane's altar.
13. Faint graffiti—names, dates and so on—mar one wall. One set—“JK + IL”—stands out from the rest.
14. Dark, flickering shadows fill the fane's deepest reaches.
15. Six plain pewter cups stand atop a two-gallon barrel halffilled with harsh-tasting brandy.
16. Black, oily water fills a crude font hacked from a slab of rock. Rearing from the floor like a striking, primaeval serpent the font itself seems ready to attack.
17. The floor is of laid flagstones; each has an esoteric symbol of ominous shape carved into its upper surface. Graffiti defaces one flagstone. It reads, “Hail his unending dark glory”.
18. The lower portion of a frayed tapestry 15-foot long and a little over five-foot-high is scorched and burnt. Ash and soot cover the rest, obscuring whatever scene the tapestry once displayed.
19. Voluminous black and red silk robes, an unholy symbol sewn into the chest, complete with deep hoods hang from wooden pegs. The robes are sized for humans.
20. A small oaken box stands on a slim three-foot-high stone pillar. A small hole pierces the box's lid which is padlocked shut. The box contains coins—offerings left by the fane's congregation. 

## GENERAL SHRINE DECORATIONS 



1. Skull and bone carvings decorate the walls and ceiling.
2. Crude drawings done in charcoal of tentacles and other disquieting, sinister shapes cover every flat surface.
3. A list of names (of sacrifices) along with dates (of the unfortunate's death) daubed in blood cover the walls. There are hundreds of entries.
4. Gleaming white skulls fill scores of niches cut into the walls and pillars. Prayers to the shrine's patron cover the surrounding walls in an array of handwriting and styles.
5. Long, plain curtains of red, yellow, black and purple hang from the chapel's walls or pillars.
6. Grotesque piles of bones arranged in strange shapes dot the chapel's floor.
7. Articulated skeletons draped upon wooden posts stand along the shrine's walls and flank the altar. Fell symbols daubed in blood cover the walls and floor.
8. Many half-completed, or ill-formed, statues carved into the walls and pillars are designed to look like the carved creatures are clawing their way out of the stone.
9. Frescoes (or tapestries) of horrible, otherworldly scenes of the patron's home plane cover the walls.
10. A checkerboard of red and black tiles covers the floor.
11. A huge unholy symbol carved in bas-relief dominates one wall. The symbol is at least ten feet high.
12. A massive carving of the dark lord's symbol decorates the floor. It must be walked upon to reach the altar. 





## THE ALTAR 



1. Twisted and scorched sets of armour—many emblazoned with a holy symbol and containing decomposing body parts—comprise this altar.
2. Comprising a sturdy table built from wood taken from an Abyssal forest and covered in a thick, blood-encrusted hide torn from some primaeval beast, this altar is a relic in its own right. A pit in front of it holds a great mass of bones—the leavings of the priests' many sacrifices.
3. The shrine's altar stands upon a five-foot-high stone plinth, dominating the chamber. Four sets of worn, shallow steps lead up to the altar.
4. A shallow 20-foot-wide fire pit stands in front of the altar. Within lies a mass of charred wood, ash and other unidentifiable things. A small pile of oiled wood stands behind the altar, ready for the next service.
5. Fell magic imbues the fabric of the altar; a faint, grey mist constantly flows from its stone, filling the surrounding room to a depth of two-foot. As mist drifts from the shrine, it slowly evaporates into nothingness.
6. A jagged chunk of black basaltic rock serves as the shrine's altar. The top of the boulder has been smoothed and deep grooves are cut in the rock to channel and catch the sacrifice's blood. Deep niches in the rear of the altar hold several prayer books, sacrificial weapons and dirty bowls used to collect blood and internal organs torn from the living creatures sacrificed on the altar.
7. Tiny pinprick-sized holes pierce the altar's upper surface. The altar contains a cunningly hidden compartment filled with dried and congealing blood. The door to the compartment faces the congregation and can be opened by pressing down on a certain part of the altar. Opening the door causes a wave of congealed blood and gore to slop forth.
8. A vast pile of bones covers the floor around the altar. In places, the bones are three-foot deep; the pile contains the remains of scores of individuals dumped here after their sacrifice. Some might animate as guardians.
9. This altar comprises hundreds of skulls bound together with magics of the most ineffable sort. The skulls begin murmuring as good-aligned individuals approach and scream in anger if such a living creature touches or is placed upon the altar. The altar stands in the centre of a large pentagram daubed on the floor in dried blood.
10. The unholy sigil of the shrine's patron is cut into the altar top. Dried blood and gore fill the grooves.
11. A shallow pit lies beneath the altar. Within lies the skeletal remains of the shrine's first high priest or some other luminary. This could also serve as the resting place of an unholy relic or profaned good-aligned relic.
12. This altar comprises a chunk of razor-sharp, magically hardened smoked glass. Disturbing shadows—thrown by two nearby braziers—writhe in and around the altar. A large pentagram, picked out in silver and gold, covers the floor around the altar.
13. An irregularly shaped chunk of grey rock shot through with red veins of some kind of mineral serves as the shrine's altar. Chips in its surface show where a sacrificial blade has been wielded a little too enthusiastically.
14. Of stone, this blackened and scorched altar looks like it has been repeated set aflame. The faint smell of burnt flesh hangs in the air around the altar. A small coffer behind the altar holds a half dozen vials of particularly flammable, foul-smelling oil.
15. Gnarled, rust-red roots have burst from the floor to entwine themselves around the altar. The roots are preternaturally tough and resist cutting or burning. Reconsecrating the shrine to a good-aligned power, or dousing the roots with holy water, causes them to quickly shrivel and crumble to dust.
16. Almost 15-foot-long, this altar is designed to “host” two sacrifices at once. Roll again to determine its other notable features.
17. Roughly hewn from the stone comprising the floor, this altar is immoveable. Iron bands set with glimmering black and red gemstones decorate the sides of this symbol-graven altar.
18. Built from hundreds of leg and rib bones, this altar is bound together by the souls of all those who have died for the glory of the shrine's patron. Only an exorcism or similarly powerful divine magic sunders the bond holding the altar together.
19. Forged from an irregularly shaped lump of iron, the altar has many symbols graven into its surfaces. A faint, but noticeable, warmth emanates from the altar.
20. A mix of lead and bones fills a rent in this altar, which was clearly almost cleaved in two by a single, titanic blow at some point in the past. 





### ALTAR DRESSING 



1. Standing next to a coiled, thick silver chain this golden thurible is constructed to look like a tiny cage. Beautifully wrought figures contorted in poses of agony are visible inside. Flickering flames in the thurible make it look like the tiny figures' shadows are writhing in agony. About the altar, flecks of dry, rust-red blood decorate the floor.
2. A cluster of small bottles and jars stands behind the altar; they contain certain unguents and powders used during the foul services held here.
3. Of beaten bronze, this old, fragile bell hangs from a new wrought iron stand. Faint and worn illegible carvings decorate the bell while bloody handprints—obviously from many different individuals—cover the altar.
4. Dried blood and flecks of gore cover the altar. Dried vomit and blood stain its rear. The altar smells of decay.
5. A miniature gong, complete with a tiny bone hammer, stands atop the altar. Nearby lie a set of pan pipes crafted from hollowed-out bones.
6. A scroll of cured human skin, which bears a prayer of cosmic evil, lies unfurled on the altar. A skull holds down each corner of the scroll. With glimmering black gemstones (onyx) inserted in their eye sockets, and complicated whorl patterns etched into their forehead these highly polished human skulls are macabre works of art.
7. A small brass idol stands atop the altar. It is worn as if it has been caressed by hands uncountable. Four candlesticks covered in melted wax cluster about the idol. A small, stout wooden box holds another dozen thick candles whose shape is reminiscent of long bones.
8. This wickedly curved sacrificial dagger has a hollow blade and handle so that when it is plunged into a living sacrifice's heart the blood sprays forth over the priest carrying out the sacrifice. Two heavy pairs of rusted and blood-soaked manacles are set into the altar's top.
9. A single candle, as thick as a man's forearm, stands on the altar amid a puddle of melted wax. A vast array of teeth—some cracked and broken—fill the many cracks and niches pockmarking the altar.
10. A bloodstained leather scourge set with jagged shards of rusty chainmail is coiled atop the altar.
11. A small pyramid of skulls decorates the altar. A half-dozen broken or bent holy symbols belonging to a range of good-aligned powers lie around the pyramid. Dried blood coats many of the symbols.
12. A small brazier filled with ash and splintered, scorched fragments of bone and other unidentifiable things stands upon the altar.
13. Ready for the next ceremony, the altar has been doused with unholy water.
14. A ragged white bloodstained sheet covers the altar. The bloody remains of the last sacrifice lie upon the sheet.
15. A small iron-bound coffer contains a score or so burnt, smashed or bent holy symbols belonging to common good-aligned faiths. Some symbols have empty mounts from whence precious gems have been prised.
16. Covered in stretched, tattooed human skin, this kettle drum is a macabre, blasphemous creation. Two worn leg bones serve as drumsticks.
17. This nameless book, bound in some kind of supernaturally tough leather-type material, contains a discourse on the nature of Hell and the Abyss along with descriptions of their denizens' characteristics.
18. A single glisteningly pure white feather fully two-footlong plucked from an angel's wing lies on the altar. Steeped in blood and ichor, a glimmer of goodness yet lingers in the feather—a glimmer the fane's priests are keen to stamp out.
19. Affixed to a golden base this inhuman skull has had its top removed and the brain cavity coated with molten lead. Within the “cup” lurks a foul-smelling liquid filled with unidentifiable chunks of horrible things.
20. A scroll wrought from flayed and stretched (human) skin contains a litany written in blood dedicated to the shrine's patron. This foul thing fills a simple one-footsquare wooden frame. An ornate wooden chair, black with age and worn smooth by countless years of use, has a back carved into the likeness of a mass of coiled serpents. It stands mere feet from the altar. 





## CLERGY & PRISONERS 



1. ELINA ITKONEN (PRIESTESS) This darkly beautiful woman wears plain, but tight-fitting, robes designed to show off her impressive curves. Elina Itkonen (CE female human cleric) comes from a family of rich merchants. Spoiled her entire childhood, she fell under the influence of a demon-worshipping maid and slew her father in a fit of pique when he denied her a new dress. Personality: Utterly merciless, Elina covets the high priestess' position and has no moral compass beyond pleasing herself. Elina is capable of deep, but transitory, love. Mannerisms: Elina is well aware of her beauty; her every movement is calculated to distract and confuse others. Hook: Elina is plotting against one of the other priesthood, who rebuffed her advances. She sees the characters as useful pawns to use in exacting her revenge.
2. LILITH GIRSU (PRIESTESS) Short and dumpy with dark brown hair and blue eyes this woman wears a plain black robe cinched at the waist with a chain-link belt decorated with tiny devil and demon pendants. Lilith Girsu (CE female human cleric) believes a guardian demon protects her and has visions of strange things. Personality: Deluded in her belief in an otherworldly guardian, Lilith is a dangerous foe. Capricious and sadistic, she enjoys inflicting pain on others. Mannerisms: Lilith uses curses voluminously and speaks in an archaic fashion using words long fallen from use. Hook: A minor trickster spirit is bounded to Lilith's chainlink belt; it sends her strange dreams and enjoys manipulating its “owner”. If the belt is claimed by another, it simply transfers its attention to that unfortunate.
3. MAKOA DER (PRIEST) Obese with a sallow countenance and ill-fitting, stained robes this man wears his short-cropped black hair slicked back. Makoa Der (CE male human cleric) bullies anyone weaker than himself but is terrified of pain and physical violence. Personality: Scared for much of the time, Makoa is convinced his fellow priests are plotting against him. Mannerisms: Makoa's whole demeanour screams “coward” for all to see; he rarely makes eye contact with others and seeks to avoid offence wherever possible. Hook: Makoa surrenders as soon as he is injured and begs for mercy. He tries to ingratiate himself with his captors and doesn't want to pay for his crimes.
4. SATU MARKKU (PRISONER) Clad in dirty, ragged commoner's clothes this dirty, horribly thin woman has her left arm bound in a crude sling. Satu Markku (NG female human) believes she has nothing to live for and is nearly catatonic with fear. She has seen her husband and children sacrificed and now waits to die. Personality: A broken woman, Satu barely clings to reason. The deaths of her family have left her without purpose; if she is not helped through the aftermath of her ordeal, she'll likely drink herself to death. Mannerisms: Clutching herself with her one good arm, Satu huddles in a corner shivering uncontrollably. She speaks softly and often bursts into tears. Hook: If given half a chance, she wildly attacks any of the fane's clergy taken prisoner by the party. If she is not restrained, she'll beat them to death.
5. SOLALITH WILMATYN (PRISONER) Wiry and tough, this half-elf wears ripped and torn peasant's clothes. Defiance blazes in his eyes. Solalith Wilmatyn (NE male half-elf assassin) tried to assassinate one of the fane's priests but was caught. His fate remains unclear; the high priest has not yet decided whether to sacrifice or recruit the brutal, ruthless half-elf. Personality: Ruthless and vindictive, Solalith sacrifices anyone to ensure his own survival or advancement. Blessed with deep insights into what makes people tick, Solalith is a master manipulator. Mannerisms: Solalith has a penetrating, challenging stare; he never blinks. Hook: Seemingly a peasant, Solalith offers a surprisingly large reward for his rescue and return to civilisation. He explains the amount away as his family's life savings. The money may—or may not—materialise.
6. VARMA ERONEN (PRISONER) Manacled hand and foot this woman has been viciously beaten—her face is a mass of bruises and her nose is obviously broken. Varma Eronen (LG female human paladin 4) tried to slay all she found in the temple, but was taken prisoner; the fane's clergy have enjoyed beating her. Personality: Varma is pious and feels responsible for the other prisoners' safety. She is brave and eagerly joins the fight against any surviving clergy. Mannerisms: Obviously in pain, Varma is stoic in the extreme and won't accept healing until her fellows have been tended. Hook: Varma wants to save the souls of any surviving members of the fane's clergy. She believes only the cleansing fire will save their immortal souls and plans to burn them all to death for their good. 





# FANE OF GOOD 







## MAJOR FANE FEATURES 



1. Two statues of the fane's deity flank the main entrance, welcoming worshippers and visitors with open arms. Behind them, in the lobby, shelves display religious items, boxes for donations to the poor and so on. Teachings from holy scripture decorate the walls.
2. Brightly iconic symbols adorn sconces burning pure perfumed oils. Each sconce has a hidden religious icon covering a ceramic plate that, when pressed, sprays a refreshing burst of perfume spray either onto the operator's hands and face or into the air.
3. Various tapestries depicting the deity's place in the universe hang from the fane's walls. These enable agitated worshippers who recite the correct mantra to reach a state of calm conducive to worship. Clerics and the like may gain extra spells or skills if they chant the correct incantations in front of each tapestry.
4. Veined stone patterns flow from the floor up the walls to the ceiling, seeming to give the impression the fane is hewn from a single piece of stone.
5. Confession booths and alcoves pierce the walls in many parts of the fane. Each booth has a different coloured velvet curtain emblazoned with the symbol of the fane's patron. Enchantments mask sounds coming from the booths so confessions cannot be overheard.
6. Iconic depictions of great and heroic deeds and worship decorate the fane's walls. Touching an icon activates a permanent magic mouth that describes the history and scene of the icon.
7. A small antechamber contains a hospital for the care of the fane's followers and those waging the unending battle against evil. Various kinds of healing potions can also be purchased from the hospital.
8. The fane's altar has side and top panels that can slide in and out for sermons, rituals and other acts of worship. A moodstone panel can, for instance, be inserted to reflect the speaker's mood. The panel glows a sapphire colour if the speaker has total belief in the fane's patron, while those of lesser attainment will show (in order), lapis, turquoise, jade, topaz, amber and onyx black for the complete non-believer.
9. The fane's nave or most significant space has a giant statue of its god or patron that radiates holy light.
10. The highest point of the fane is a small cylindrical shrine solely for the use of the upper echelons of the fane's hierarchy. Here they hold special ceremonies, rituals or pray for messages direct from the fane's patron. The shrine can be illuminated with holy light that wells outwards to shine on the worshipping followers below.
11. Silvered bottles of communion wines and goblets are stored within the altar, each with a particular function in the fane's religious ceremonies.
12. Murals and messages for the fane's followers decorate the walls from ground level all the way up to the ceiling. The messages speak of the glory of the fane's patron and of the duty of each follower to become a priest and to spread word of the faith.
13. Inside the fane's main entrance are shelves of religious texts, hymn books, illuminated iconic envelopes, pads and calligraphic inks in many colours devoted to followers worshipping the fane's patron.
14. The aroma of incense and perfume pervades the interior of the fane. The aromas give off soothing and hallucinogenic gaseous vapours for the benefit of those breathing them in.
15. Some parts of the fane are being repaired and upgraded at the congregation's expense. All who worship here give a tithe (one-tenth) of their income for the upkeep of the buildings and its staff.
16. For a fee, higher orders of the fane can dispense blessings and holy lit objects to visitors.
17. Lift cradles on the fane's walls can elevate groups of worshippers to celebrate holy acts.
18. Mandalic patterns adorn parts of the fane's floor, allowing worshippers to recite mantras to rest or receive benefits from the fane's patron.
19. One part of the fane contains crypt headstones for the saints and other notable deceased of the fane's faith.
20. Around several walls, in small alcoves, stand armoured stone figures, ready to animate and defend the fane. These defenders might be animate statues or golems. 





## MINOR FANE FEATURES 



1. A scent of some kind of floral perfume pervades the fane. Breathing the aroma for more than a few minutes can cause mild euphoria, but also—perhaps—sneezing, wheezing and a dry hacking cough that persists for some time after the character has left the area.
2. An effigy of a sizeable holy symbol is set into the floor. Investigating further reveals a secret compartment that once contained sacred tomes and objects, together with a recess that once held some form of key to open something elsewhere.
3. A cone of sunlight shines into the fane's undercroft through cracks in the ceiling. The light illuminates a faded holy icon set into the floor. Investigation reveals the holy icon has been here from ancient times and was part of a long-forgotten fane of good that stood on the same site. Fragments of vestments and old robes still hang from rusted hooks on the walls.
4. Wind chimes gracefully ring out in the calm, soothing breezes blowing through this room.
5. Hollows in the fane's walls show elements of where sconces had once been. Further investigation reveals a soft leather pouch containing an elaborately carved silver candle holder (perhaps worth 25 gp to the right buyer) hidden in one of the hollows.
6. A silken cloth lies on the ground, emblazoned with a holy icon. On closer investigation, a trace of blood can be seen on one corner, as though it had been used to recently clean a dirty sword blade.
7. An empty holy incense jar lies in one corner of the room. Its silver cap and fine workmanship make it worth 5 gp.
8. The sweet sound of an angelic voice permeates the room. Regardless of how perceptive the party are, they can never discover where the voice is coming from.
9. A small circular basin adorned with angelic icons catches water running down the room's central pillar. Characters searching the basin find a small black gem (an onyx worth 5 gp), 3 sp and 5 cp.
10. The charred remains of an old religious book lie in plain sight in an old fireplace. If magically restored in some fashion, the book reveals the story of an adventuring crusade of the holy order, together with some handwritten “field” notes at the back of the book.
11. The way forward to a private section of the fane is through an ornate old marble door with a prominent holy symbol carved into its face. The door is locked.
12. Some vintage bottles of red wine lie forgotten on the fane's lowest level. The wine has aged well and is really nice to drink.
13. One wall of the fane depicts several views of an elaborate religious ceremony held under a starlit sky and crescent moon. The stars and crescent moon glimmer enticingly—the artist used crushed silver in the paint.
14. A fresco shows druids performing a sacred ceremony under some standing stones; several animals—of surprising types—stand around watching the druids. A careful examination of the scene reveals the animals are actually participating in the ceremony.
15. A stone chessboard on a pedestal sits in the middle of the room. It has granite white and black chess pieces. The white pieces depict prominent saints and the like while the black pieces depict devils, demons and powerful undead.
16. An ornate, but now faded, sigil of the fane's divine patron is emblazoned on the fane's ceiling. The sigil covers almost the entire ceiling, but is in need of repair. The original artist used bright colours, but the pigments are now faded and peeling.
17. Some relics captured in various crusades are displayed in alcoves around the fane's walls throughout the structure. Each has an inscription describing what they are, where they were found and who found them.
18. A lit candle is burning in an angelic style gothic candle holder on a nearby fane wall. Observing the candle reveals the candle doesn't melt as it burns. The candle cannot be snuffed out—it has been treated with a magical light spell and will keep burning until the candle disintegrates with age.
19. Some gold and silver coins, stamped with the symbol of the fane's order, lie amid the detritus at the bottom of an old, weathered fountain. The fountain's subterranean pipes are blocked and water no longer flows to it.
20. A large moonstone is set into the fane's wall, near the altar. Touching the moonstone causes it to change colour depending on the character's mood. The stone changes to a sapphire colour if the character is happy and content, while those of greater emotional turmoil will show (in order), lapis (blue), turquoise, jade, topaz or amber and, for the foulest mood, onyx black. 





## FOLK OF THE FANE 



1. LONDINIUM GARFAEL (SCHOLAR) This small pointy-nosed gnome wears short, dark green robes and boots. He carries a large black satchel with him. Londinium Garfael (N male gnome) studies genealogical records to determine whether any living (or undead) relative of a missing, deceased or undead entity is entitled to a share of the poor departed's wealth and possessions. Personality: Londriel comes over as a very personable gnome. He is perceptive and always seems to ask the right questions to find what he's looking for. He yelps in triumph, when he is successful. Mannerisms: Rarely looking up from his books, Londinium doesn't mind a flagon of strong ale (or two) while he's working! Hook: One of Londriel's clients is a vampire looking for new victims no one will miss. The vampire has agreed to share the spoils with Londrinian, who intends to build a repository in the fane of good for ancient tomes and family history for future generations.
2. NOREN FOSREN (ARCHITECT) This well-dressed, man has dark hair. He wears rough workman's clothes and carries a drawing kit and large rolls of parchment paper. Noren Fosren (N male human) seeks nothing more than to draft plans for interesting buildings for his patrons. Personality: Noren is always looking for fresh ideas for his next “way out there” building project. He nods in approval when he sees something beautiful and unusual. Mannerisms: Noreo is a lovely chap and is always willing to talk about his travels with anybody who cares to listen. Hook: Noren is a conman who wants to get marks to sign contracts to construct his buildings. He doesn't tell them that most of the construction materials are unobtainable, his builders are corrupt and he overspends on every aspect of the work and pockets the rest. He's visiting the fane to try and get a commission to extend the library or hospital.
3. RAVAN BRAMLON (PRIEST) This man has a long white beard and wears white and silver robes. He carries a golden sickle decorated with the moon symbol of his faith. Ravan Bramlon (N male half-elf druid 3) exudes authority and makes no secret of his love of nature in all its glorious variety or his hatred of disbelievers. Personality: Ravan has a very stoic character, and he enjoys quoting from sagas and ballads in conversation. Mannerisms: Ravan speaks in a deep voice, liking to point and stare at those of whom he does not approve. Hook: Ravan's real interest is being a pagan. He leads a secret society in the nearby woods conducting ancient rituals and has links with the local guilds to provide suitable followers and, occasionally, sacrifices.
4. SIR GRANDEN (ELDERLY PALADIN) This imposing elderly man has an enormous moustache. He wears battered, but polished plate armour. Sir Granden (LG male human paladin 7) craves nothing more than to rid the land of anything and everything he deems unholy or evil. Personality: Sir Granden is pious and generous; he gives most of his wealth to worthy causes. He loves throwing banquets and telling stuttering stories of his exploits to those who can wait around all day to listen. Mannerisms: Sir Granden talks very slowly, only opening up about the true horrors of his adventures after drinking several flagons of his favourite ale. Hook: Sir Granden is, in reality, just a front man for a gang of thieves. Sir Granden's memory is not very good, and he records all his contacts in a supposedly arcane locked diary. However, one of his servants is an expert thief who can break the diary's code and use the resultant intelligence to plan the gang's jobs.
5. SISTER MARIAN (MONK) This elderly woman wears a bright white hooded robe emblazoned with monastic icons of her temple and order. Sister Marian (LG female human monk 3) devotes her life to helping the poor and needy; she runs an almshouse and monastic temple to help the unfortunate find a better life. Personality: Sister Marian is always seeking help to look after her patients. She spares no effort to ensure they are looked after well. Mannerisms: Sister Marian is a lady of few words and has little time for those who mean harm, preferring to stand and fight against aggression against her patients. She gratefully receives gifts and is always looking for worthy projects to help those in need. Hook: Secretly, Sister Marian is building up a force of trained warrior-monks called the “Marians" to rid the surrounds of undead and other loathsome monsters. She is so devoted to this task that many weapons and suits of armour have been “borrowed” from local armouries to equip her forces—to the annoyance of the local governing council. 
6. SURIEL VALANTETH (WORSHIPPER) This wizened, middle-aged woman wears simple loose-fitting clothes, cinched together with a leather belt decorated with religious symbols. Suriel Valanteth (LG female human) chides anyone less devout than herself, believing her faith will protect her from all harm. Personality: Suriel is a devout believer who tries to convert anybody around her—whether they want to be converted or not. Mannerisms: Suriel appears reserved, but can be inclined to violence if provoked. Hook: Suriel is secretly planning to leave the faith. Having become tired of just being a functionary, she seeks to see more of the outside world and wishes to become an adventurer. Suriel is secretly looking to join a group of “likeminded” adventurers and then eventually return to the fane to become a priest.
7. TAYSA UMBRIEL (FOLLOWER) This short, broad-shouldered human knight takes pride in her shiny metal armour and holy broadsword, prominently decorated with the holy symbol of her order. Taysa Umbral (LG female human paladin 5) seeks advice from those of great virtue about fulfilling her oath to her king while being a prominent follower of the order. (Sadly, the oath might contravene certain teachings of her faith which causes her considerable distress.) Personality: Taysa is an itinerant paladin knight in the service of the local ruler. She is stern and slow to anger but is friendly and outgoing if a good deed is in the offing. Mannerisms: Taysa speaks with a rustic accent and has a habit of using aphorisms to make her point. Hook: Taysa is dissatisfied with the local ruler, who she believes is up to no good. She wants her view of the world to be heroic and to serve a cause that enables her to live up to her ideals, even if others do not.
8. TROPE TESSLE (ADVENTURING BARD) This scarred and liberally tattooed middle-aged golden-haired man wears bright gold studded leather armour and wields a shiny silver-edged long sword. Trope Tassle (NG male human fighter 2) seeks a life of adventure and fulfilment, taking on all comers and quests to fulfil his curiosity.Personality: Trope does not care for ditherers but loves working with the local hospice. He does this by takingfrom the rich and giving some of it back to the poor. Mannerisms: Trope always tells a tale, usually in an excited, loud voice that can be heard for miles around. Hook: Trope's secret passion is unarmed combat and he is training at the local monastery whenever he can. In addition, Trope is training some of the monks to become fighters and looks forward to leading them on future quests.









## ADVENTURE HOOKS 



1. The party discovers an isolated grove in the middle of a desolate swamp. This is a druidic place with a tree trunk altar that shows frequent use. This natural fane was once frequented by a druid sect experimenting with nature magic to return the swamp to the forest. However, assassins have recently slain the entire sect on orders from a rival lord, working closely with a tribe of lizardfolk in the area. Careful investigation reveals the assassins' and lizardfolks' tracks, which lead to the tribe's settlement. The assassins are also at the settlement— waiting to get paid.
2. While spending downtime at the fane, one of the priests has a vision. In the vision, one of the congregation becomes the new local lord, but only if he is prevented from committing a burglary. The priest contacts the party to safeguard and protect the lord-to-be. The priest doesn't know the individual is a member of the local thieves guild, who has been commissioned to steal valuables from the local lord's house. The follower is destined to meet the lord's daughter in a few days, fall in love with her and eventually get married. However, if he meets the daughter while committing the crime, he is caught, sentenced and executed.
3. In the fane, the party hears a dying monk's last words, "Seek justice for Frederick”. Investigation reveals Frederick was a long-time member of the order who disappeared months ago. Frederick is being held without charge in a nearby town for a crime he definitely didn't commit. The fane's clergy look very kindly on the party if they rescue him.
4. The party receive an unusual request from a local cleric. He confesses to being tempted by a demon and would like the party's help. The party doesn't know the demon is a succubus, who will stop at nothing to stop the party from meddling with her future plans to control the town and, eventually, the local fane.
5. While the party is working for the local lord, they discover that recent corruption attempts on a local cleric have forced him into exile at the local hospice. On further investigation, the cleric discovered a plot from a bandit group to extort money from the town's governing council. If the town does not pay up, the bandits will unleash a plague on its unsuspecting residents. The party can find the expertise and resources at the local fane of good to make a vaccine to stop the plague from spreading. Can the fane's patron and the party entice enough of the local population to take the vaccine before it's too late?
6. A small orphanage attached to the fane receives a demand for protection money from a local gang. If they are paid, the gang feeds the money to a local bandit band that wants to control the town and use the orphanage as a base. If the players defeat the gang, the orphanage's staff are eternally grateful.
7. The party is contacted by the clergy of the local fane about a missing priest of the order. The fane offers a handsome reward for information about the priest's location or rescue. In reality, a demon possessed the priest, seeking to wreak havoc in the town and the fane of good. The priest has made his base in an old ruined watchtower a few miles from town and is well guarded by lesser fiends and demons. A ritual is needed to exorcise the demon from the unfortunate priest.
8. A band of cultists has taken refuge in the fane, and the party is asked to find out why they are there. The cultists have performed a summoning ritual that went horribly wrong and fled to the fane for protection. The cultists are covered with strange marks and sigils, which require ritual cleansing to remove.
9. The fane of good has just taken in a group of nuns on the run. The clergy would like the party to investigate what's going on, and what the nuns are running from. If asked, the nuns relate they were collecting donations for their hospice when a gang of thugs attacked them. Bringing the thugs to justice would significantly improve the party's relations with the local fane's clergy.
10. A local magistrate is found dead in his quarters, with evidence implicating a worshipper at the local fane. In reality, a criminal has sought revenge against the faith for some real or imagined slight and seeks to implicate the clergy by leaving holy items at the murder scene. The party will gain significant influence and gratitude from the clergy if they can track down and arrest the criminal. 





# FARMING VILLAGE 







## DAYTIME SIGHTS & SOUNDS 



1. Children clad in dirty shifts run along the road laughing and joking among themselves; they quiet at the sight of the adventurers and give the party a wide berth.
2. A villager pushes a handcart along the road piled high with wood freshly cut from a nearby copse. A woodsman's axe balances precariously atop the woodpile. The villager nods a friendly greeting as he passes by.
3. Thin streams of smoke drift upwards from several chimneys. From the nearby houses, the laughter of children and the everyday sounds of life softly fill the air.
4. Villagers work in the fields, ploughing the earth, weeding and so on. Here and there, children run up and down waving their arms and shouting to scare away the birds that land to peck at the soil and the seeds therein.
5. A trader (see Table 4 for sample NPCs) rumbles into the village on a cart piled high with boxes, barrels and sacks. Several children run alongside the cart laughing and the trader shouts at them to get away.
6. A flock of birds nesting in a stand of trees at the end of the village suddenly screech and take flight. Perceptive characters spot a cat slinking through the trees.
7. Villagers—both alone and in small groups—walk the streets going about their daily business. Most greet the characters with nods or smiles although a few seem scared or awed by the adventurers, their weapons and their relative wealth.
8. The clang of metal on metal—the sounds of the village blacksmith at work—fill the air.
9. Two villagers carrying baskets, and deep in conversation, stroll toward the characters.
10. A trapper returns to the village, the skinned and gutted bodies of a half-dozen rabbits hanging from a long pole he carries over his shoulder.
11. Urgent calls for help, and wild gesticulations, from a pair of villagers working in a field, indicate a horrible accident has just occurred. Moments later, one of the villagers collapses.
12. A chill wind blows through the village, plucking at the characters' cloaks and sending the smoke drifting from the villagers' homes wildly cavorting through the air.
13. A gaggle of running, laughing commoner children surround the characters; they are playing “Catch Me If You Can” and the party are a handy obstacle to be used to avoid capture.
14. Three women stand close together deep in conversation; nearby a dog noses through the woods in search of an interesting smell.
15. A cat sits atop a high roof, watching people come and go below. At the other end of the roof, two birds are doing much the same.
16. As #15 above, but slowly—so slowly—the cat edges down the roof toward the birds.
17. Clouds scud across the sky, bringing alternating patches of light and shadow to the village.
18. Heavy rain lashes the village. As the day goes on, the roads turn into muddy morasses.
19. A horseman, in a fearful rush, gallops through the village. Villagers scatter in his wake.
20. A distant roar—perhaps a bear, troll or other wandering predator—echoes through the air. 





## NIGHTTIME SIGHTS & SOUNDS 



1. A mangy cat emerges from the undergrowth into the soft moonlight holding something in its mouth. It darts across the road and into the shadow of a building.
2. From somewhere off in the distance, an owl hoots loudly. A few minutes later, the owl hoots again, but this time from further away. A soft wind blows across the village, rustling the leaves and crops.
3. Thick clouds scud across the sky. As they pass in front of the moon, the village is plunged into periods of neartotal darkness.
4. Soft laughter emerges from deep shadows clustering about a tree or building. Perceptive characters—or those with the ability to see in the dark—spot two villagers locked in a passionate embrace. The two are blissfully— and completely— unaware of the characters.
5. The sounds of drinking, laughter and revelry emerge from the village tavern. Outside the tavern, several people stand around drinking and talking.
6. A husband and wife sit outside their house enjoying a quiet conversation and drink. They watch the adventurers as the party passes. The man gestures at them, says something, and the woman laughs softly.
7. A rustling at the side of the road presages the appearance of a mongrel dog—perhaps a stray or a farmer's pet—with a stick in its mouth. It looks at the characters, drops the stick and wags its tail.
8. A fox darts through the village, accompanied by its two pups, looking for prey. It is cautious and avoids any large group of people, but could be coaxed out into the open by a druid, ranger or the like.
9. A farmer carrying a partially shuttered lantern hurries through to his field. The man is absent-minded and left a valuable tool—a hoe—there when he finished work. He is worried someone has stolen the hoe and is barely civil to the characters if they engage him in conversation.
10. Field mice nose about among the weeds and grass growing between buildings in search of food. Only perceptive characters, spot the tiny creatures.
11. Two men—one carrying a blazing torch—march through the village. Both are armed with a spear and wear leather armour; the men are in the militia and tonight is their turn to “do the rounds”. They do not expect any trouble—the patrol is a local tradition that stems from bandit attacks long ago.
12. A man staggers down the road, singing quietly to himself. He is clearly drunk. As the characters approach, he totters off in the other direction. Shortly thereafter, the characters hear a soft thud as he falls over. 





## VILLAGERS 



1. Albin Kari (NG middle-aged male human) is a brawny fellow well used to long days spent working in the fields. His clothes are dirty and his hands are calloused. He is respectful, but wary, of heavily armed strangers.
2. Leena Ilma (NG female human) carries a full basket of household supplies—a small bag of flour, a selection of vegetables and so on—on her hip. (She is off to barter with the village blacksmith for some urgent repairs.)
3. Eljas Kekko (CN young male human) is the terror of the village. Wild, precocious and out of control he wanders the streets looking for mischief—and the adventurers as newcomers are his new target. His father is a drunk, and his mother is dead. Eljas is big and strong for his age and has distinctively short-cropped brown hair.
4. Azakial Vonothvar (NE male half-elf thief 2) came to the village 20 years ago to escape a murder charge in the nearby city. He finds life in the village boring, but safe, and is looking for excitement. He has a wife he doesn't really like and yearns for escape. The characters' arrival may tempt him to put his old skills to use once more. Azakial has jet black hair and violet eyes.
5. Liisa Arpia (CG young female human) is brave and inquisitive and obsessed with adventurers. If the characters are obviously adventuring types, she hangs around them trying to overhear their stories and so on. Liisa dreams of becoming a powerful wizard and of wandering the land slaying evil. Her parents—poor peasants—have no way of paying for the education necessary to make her dream come true; she tries to talk any wizard in the group into taking her on as an apprentice. Liisa has startlingly blue eyes and platinum blonde hair.
6. Filpus Ilma (CN young male human) never goes anywhere without his beloved mongrel Brak (N dog). Brak has mottled black and white fur and is little more than skin and bone. The two are inseparable and spend much of their time playing in the fields to keep birds and other pests away from the crops. Filpus is inquisitive and the arrival of adventurers intrigues both Filpus and Brak. Sadly, Filpus has a seemingly inexhaustible supply of questions; if indulged, he asks his questions one after another after another.
7. Katri Ano (N old female human) is the oldest human in the village and is a great store of local legends, lore and gossip. Despite her age, she has a prodigious memory and her mind remains sharp. She walks with a cane and her eyesight is not good. Katri spends her time visiting friends and chatting, and she can be encountered almost anywhere in the village.
8. Juho Paaso (CE male human) is a blackguard and villain. Near universally reviled by his neighbours, Juho only cares for himself. Currently embroiled in several disputes with other villagers over debts and land boundaries he sees the party as a means to an end. If given the chance, he spreads vile rumours regarding his enemies and tries to suggest any woes the village faces are their fault. With big, black bushy eyebrows, a tangled beard and gloriously untended hair he cuts a distinctive figure.
9. Hannu Viti (CN middle-aged male human) knows best. Luckily, for almost everyone he meets, Hannu is wise in whatever subject is being discussed. Most people try and get out of a conversation with Hannu as quickly as possible—and he is so wrapped up in himself he doesn't have a clue how others view him. He is stocky, shorthaired and has a podgy face riven with acne and scars from a childhood disease.
10. Riitta Tornio (NG middle-aged female human) is short and dumpy. She is Hannu's (see #9 above) long-suffering wife and knows exactly how most people view her husband. She hates confrontation and has long since given up trying to “improve” Hannu. Riita is a popular figure around the village—and would be more popular if it wasn't for her husband!
11. Sanni Torio (NG middle-aged female human) is an introvert who isn't that keen on chatting to wandering adventurer types (and anyone else she doesn't know well). Skinny, with short brown hair she loves being outside and is often accompanied by her children and dog. Sadly, her husband died several years ago in a farming accident and she is quite lonely but hasn't met anyone worth getting to know. Wealthy compared to her neighbours she is tired of fending off ill-suited suitors.
12. Esko Panu (LG male human cleric 1) is a failed village priest who would rather his past stay in the past. Thrown out of his church in a distant village for inappropriate contact with a woman in his congregation he has fled here to hide and atone for his sins. He has managed to keep his past and spellcasting abilities (mostly) a secret— one neighbouring family knows of his powers after he saved their son from a nasty injury inflicted by a poorlywielded scythe. He is wary of others from his faith, suspecting any clerics among the party are searching for him so he may be returned to his former church for punishment. Esko comes across as surprisingly charismatic and well-read for a “normal” peasant. Note: Most villagers are normal, mundane folk. If a villager presented above has no class listed assume they are a typical commoner of the appropriate race. 





## TRAVELLERS 



1. Frans Vaito (N male human) is an odd-job man and labourer for hire. Afflicted with an insatiable wanderlust he never stays in any place for long. When the characters leave, he asks if he can accompany them (as long as they are not off into the wilderness on some “foolish quest”).
2. Jussi Seppo (NG male human) is a small-time merchant with dreams of the big time. After a few foolish deals, he is down on his luck but is always searching for the one trade or deal that will make him rich. If the characters seem rich he promises them he has a wide range of contacts from whom he can get almost anything. This isn't entirely true, but he does his best to meet his clients' needs. He'll need a handsome retainer, though, for expenses.
3. Miina Kulta (N female human) is ill—she has contracted the plague and although it has not yet fully manifested itself she is contagious (and feeling a little bit under the weather). Miina is a skilled silversmith looking for somewhere to settle down far away from her controlling husband. She stays at the village inn; unfortunately, her condition rapidly deteriorates.
4. Kaapro Miela (NE male human thief 3) has come to the village in search of easy marks. His plan is to travel with such a group, rob them blind one night and then flee. He particularly enjoys travelling with trusting merchants and the like. Kaapro is tall and brawny and looks more like a warrior than a thief. He suggests travelling together for “mutual protection” from bandits and the like.
5. Rekiina Salme (LN middle-aged female human) works as an agent for a wealthy merchant dwelling in a nearby city. She wanders the countryside looking for good business opportunities for her master. She is discrete and keeps her employer's details secret until a deal is done. With greying brown hair and sharp, inquisitive eyes Rekiina dresses well and travels with her trusted manservant, Silas Bramblehill (LN male halfling) who is himself a keen observer of goings-on. The two act more like friends than master and servant. Rekiina carries a substantial sum of coin.
6. Kurt Vasara (LG male human paladin 2) is a questing knight searching for evil to slay and wrongs to right. While well equipped, Kurt does not carry much wealth, trusting in his divine patron and the kindness of the common folk to provide for his daily needs. While serviceable, much of his gear is battered and dirty—he has spent much time on the road of late and is beginning to dream of a comfortable bed and a cooked meal. Kurt is muscular and tall, but a long scar runs from his forehead over his left eye and down his cheek—it is a memento of a close encounter with orcs raiders a year or so ago.
7. Aleksi Tiera (N male human) deals in scrap metal and travels the land with his horse and cart collecting up broken items and the like to sell to blacksmiths and other craftsmen in nearby towns and cities. He is a skilled woodworker, mason and general builder who barters his expertise for the scrap in which he deals. In truth, Aleksi is a spy for a powerful lord; being a scrap merchant is a cover for his real job—keeping an eye out for threats and opportunities his lord can exploit.
8. Orkas Kilak (LG male dwarf fighter 2) is on the way to a nearby castle to oversee some urgent repairs caused by a nasty case of subsidence. Orkas is a smidgeon racist, and when deep in his cups at the local tavern derides all human stonemasons and builders as shoddy workmen. He also complains about the weak ale and generally annoys the locals with his boorish behaviour. Note: Most travellers are normal, mundane folk. If a traveller presented above has no class listed assume he or she is a typical commoner of the appropriate race. 





## VILLAGE DRESSING 



1. Deep wheel ruts scar the road leading through the village. In autumn or winter rainwater fills the ruts while in summer the sun bakes them hard. Incautious travellers could trip and fall if they do not take care.
2. A tall, wide-girthed tree throws its thick leafy boughs high out over the road. Graffiti, cut into the tree's bark, decorates its trunk and a swing rope hangs from one stout branch. The tree is a popular meeting place for courting couples and the like.
3. A crumbling, dilapidated barn stands amid a stand of dense weeds and saplings. Birds perch atop the barn's sagging roof, cawing loudly.
4. Weeds, brambles and other bushes grow along the road, providing many places for wildlife—and perhaps mischievous children—to hide.
5. Wide hedges of carefully tended bushes and trees separate the village fields.
6. A small, partially overgrown shrine dedicated to the god of travellers stands back from the main road leading into the village. The shrine looks little visited. Clearly, the villagers do not maintain it.
7. Many small holes dot the ground in and around the village. Most are only a few feet deep and have clearly been hurriedly excavated. If the characters ask around, they learn a party of adventurers passed through recently and were overheard discussing burying their treasure for safekeeping in the locality. The villagers are trying to find it!
8. A small, weather-beaten sign partially hidden by weeds, directs visitors to the village inn.
9. A half-full stone water trough and hitching post stand next to the road.
10. A small spring bubbles up from the ground, creating a small pond in a shallow depression. Bullrushes and the like surround the pond; children come here to swim and play in warm weather.
11. Neatly placed stones bound the major roads passing through the village. In the spring, wildflowers grow between the stones and the villagers take great care over the display.
12. A cart—one wheel broken—stands by the road; tools for repair lie nearby, but of the carter (or wheelwright) there is no sign.
13. Some sections of the village streets are cobbled, but in most places the cobbles—if they ever existed—have sunk deep into the mud.
14. Thick man-high hedges bound this part of the road from the villagers' homes and kitchen gardens. The hedges effectively channel traffic; in the wet months, this section of road is a notorious quagmire; locals avoid it.
15. Over the years the passage of so many wagons, cattle and people has eroded the road which is now a sunken lane. Steps cut into its banks reinforced with wooden risers provide access to the nearby houses.
16. Three elm trees growing in an almost straight line stand a few feet back from the road; their boughs create an area of shadow and shelter. Weary travellers often rest here, before continuing their journey. Sometimes, children gather under the trees to sell knick-knacks and refreshments or simply have fun.
17. Wind chimes hang from various trees scattered throughout the village and tinkle quietly in the breeze.
18. A small pond stands where three fields converge. A weeping willow's bough hangs low over the water; perceptive characters can hear the faint quacking of ducks emanating from the pool.
19. Stone menhirs flank the roads entering the village. The menhirs are ancient boundary posts and predate the village; no one knows who raised them or why, but several have unreadable weathered sigils carved into their surfaces. Strangely, the village has not grown beyond the markers.
20. A large tree recently fell onto a farmer's home. Luckily, no one was inside at the time, but the house was ruined. When the characters arrive, the villagers are just organising themselves to remove the tree and start repairs. The farmer's family are staying with friends; if the characters help, the villagers are delighted. 





# FECUND JUNGLE 



## CAMPING & CAMPSITES 



1. A huge, densely crowned tree casts deep shade below it, which has created a clearing of sorts. The tree stands by a small stream, making this locale an ideal campsite. (The water source may attract nocturnal animals, which could cause the party problems.)
2. Dense stands of red and black flowers surround this campsite. The flowers nod in the breeze and are laden with pollen. The soporific pollen may lull the party's guards into a deep slumber, at night.
3. A line of stone markers, overgrown with vines and tottering with age, leads to a sunken road. The road ends at an underground tunnel, which has collapsed about 40 feet from the entrance. The tunnel could make an agreeable campsite—if the party can clear it of the vipers lairing within.
4. A small cave, obscured by dense vegetation, burrows into the side of a hill. The gurgle of running water betrays a small hidden stream issuing from the hill. Monkeys dwell in the nearby trees and screech if intruders approach.
5. A low, dome-shaped barren hill provides an exposed campsite. Jungle animals shun the hill, however, so the party's rest is uninterrupted.
6. Two large trees have fallen across one another at rightangles to form two walls. Part-sunken into the soft jungle ground, the trees obscure the view of a carefully set camp. Small shrubs, vines and lichens, grow upon the trees' rotting trunks.
7. An abandoned treehouse juts from the low branches of a massive hardwood tree. The remains of a rope ladder hangs from the house's door to about 15 ft. above the ground. The house is sound, but its timbers loudly creak in strong winds or when explorers venture inside. Rotting furniture and other odds and ends lie scattered around the interior. The inhabitant's skeletal remains sprawl amid the ruin.
8. A steep-sided craggy chunk of rock rears from the jungle floor. Explorers must scale its vertiginous snakeand bird-infested flanks to reach its zenith. The hill's peak commands an excellent—if exposed—view of the surrounding terrain.
9. A gentle slope of soft, knee-high grass runs down to the bank of a fast-flowing river. Large stones in the river serve as stepping stones making it easy to cross the river's white water. Several natural hollows—on both sides of the river—offer concealment from casual observation but are prone to flooding after heavy rain.
10. A small rocky cleft provides a sheltered campsite. Unfortunately, though, the cleft is prone to flooding after all but the lightest rain. 





## LOCAL LANDMARKS 



1. A vertiginous escarpment rises from the fecund jungle. Noisy streams splash down from the Giant's Table plateau atop the escarpment. A tumbled ruin sprawls across the plateau. Only skilled climbers or birds can reach the ruin which could be a temple, palace or tomb.
2. Many small sinkholes pierce the jungle floor in this locality. Choked with rampant vegetation, the sinkhole poses a significant danger to unwary travellers. Many of the holes intersect with a labyrinthine, miles-long cave complex. A small tribe of carnivorous albino apes dwells in the caves. Knowledgeable travellers avoid this area, as a result.
3. The Old Man's House squats atop a steep-sided hill jutting through the jungle canopy. The rambling pile of tumbled stone was once a large building, and its basic floor plan is still evident. Rumours, of fell lights at night and a vampire slumbering beneath the ruin, keep locals far away.
4. The overgrown and shunned Palace of the Silver Princess lies in a narrow valley. The palace's jagged, vine-choked towers yet jut skyward; as a consequence, the place is easy to find. Legends tell of an exquisite silver statue of a beautiful princess guarding the ruin. At night, the statue comes alive to hunt and kill any interlopers invading the ruin.
5. Travellers describe this swath of low-lying, mosquitoinfested bog as a hellhole. Known as the Mire of Hopelessness it fills the land between three steep hills. Portions of the mire have the qualities of deep and deadly quicksand.
6. Stunted, gnarled and densely-packed trees choke the sunken cairns scattered about this valley. This is the Valley of the Dead. Animal activity in the valley is much reduced and random encounters with such are rare. Perceptive characters may glimpse ethereal spirits moving through the valley's lingering gloom.
7. The Giant's Road runs dead straight for five miles through the jungle. The road is 20-foot wide and paved with cut stones of impressive uniformity. Some of the paves have begun to sink under time's remorseless onslaught but the road is still useable. The road ends at a crumbling cliff edge overlooking a mist-shrouded valley. When the mists thin, stepped ruins cut into the valley's cliffs become visible. A legion of legends and wild stories hang over the valley and the ruins. Several expeditions exploring the valley have disappeared without a trace.
8. The Ziggurat of Ancient Shadow stands amid a swath of dense forest. Here, daylight rarely penetrates the forest's lofty, intertwined canopy. Legends identify a nameless race of snakefolk as the ancient's ziggurat's builders. A collapse has blocked the only obvious tunnel into the structure's interior.
9. Dense stands of mangrove trees bound this wide lake. Two islands, overrun by mangrove trees, stand amid the lake's still waters. The rotting remnant of an extensive wooden building stands on the larger of the two islands. Partly collapsed, the building was the home of an eccentric hermit who claimed the lake as his home. He has been dead for years, but locals name the place, Restless Spirit Lake. Several people have drowned in the lake, and the hermit's ghost is blamed.
10. The Well of Lost Souls pierces the bedrock of this range of oft-shunned hills. The well—a flooded sinkhole— intersects with a sunken cave system. Centuries ago, a now extinct people used the well for thousands of ritual sacrifices. Thus, did they attempt to win their bloodcrazed gods' favour, but found only their own ruin. Mounds of bones and ancient artefacts yet lie visible in the deep, clear water and ensure a trickle of visitors to the site.
11. Crowned with vine-choked trees, the Giant's Dyke forms a circle roughly one mile in diameter. Local legend has the time-worn dyke as the boundary of a giant's now decayed and lost farmstead.
12. Towering above its neighbours, the Sky Tree is over 5,000 years old. Its crown is dense and lofty. Rumours describe the Sky Tree as a wizard's tower of sorts, although no one knows who dwells at its zenith. 





## MINOR DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. Clouds of biting and stinging insects surround the party. Many of the insects carry diseases that can cause blindness; some of the party may get infected.
2. Loud rustling overhead in the trees heralds the arrival of a troop of monkeys. The monkeys play and chatter, but scatter if they detect a lurking threat. A druid, ranger or elf can befriend one or more of the monkeys. A friendly monkey does not risk its life for its new friend.
3. A leopard emerges from the dense vegetation growing hard against the trail. The big cat carries the limp body of a monkey in its mouth. The leopard regards the party without fear before darting away.
4. The party comes across a trail of booted footprints. A tracker can determine someone past this way recently. This could be another group of travellers, local hunters or a lost party's own tracks.
5. A huge constrictor snake lies coiled above the trail on a sturdy tree branch. The snake has recently eaten and is lethargic. If attacked, it slithers away to digest its meal in peace elsewhere.
6. As a party member is about to drink from their flask, an adventurous monkey jumps down from a branch and grabs it. The monkey flees, whether successful or not, to a nearby tree.
7. A small yellow- and red-striped viper slithers across the trail. It is not interested in fighting and flees if attacked. Characters blundering after it quickly lose the trail.
8. Thick spider webs stretch between the low-hanging branches of a tree near the trail. Large brown spiders scuttle about within, among the cocoons of many unfortunate insects.
9. The ground is wet and boggy, and the characters' feet quickly get soaked. If the heroes don't dry their feet when they rest they could develop trench foot. Afflicted characters only move at half speed.
10. The characters stumble out of the jungle onto the banks of a sluggish stream. The buzzing of mosquitos fills the air. Characters lingering here may get infected with malaria (or some other horrible disease).
11. Thick vines grow among the fecund moss and grass covering the ground. Unwary characters could trip and fall if they don't spot the coiled vines. The vines could be nothing more than a natural occurrence or a crude trap.
12. The characters enter a dense stretch of jungle, which they must hack their way through. Many small animals dwell in the area, but the tangle is too dense for larger creatures. Thus, this is a safe place to camp. 


## MINOR NIGHT-TIME EVENTS 



1. At night, the jungle comes alive with the roars and calls of many animals—both predators and prey. Getting a good night's sleep is difficult, in these circumstances.
2. Shafts of soft moonlight pierce the jungle canopy, lancing down to the party's campsite. As the night draws on, any guards notice the moonlight creeping toward those sleeping. It is like the shafts are some kind of silent, preternatural nighttime predator.
3. Thick clouds pass in front of the moon, plunging the jungle into deep darkness. Rustling in the undergrowth and the calls of nocturnal animals seem amplified. The jungle quietens, when the moon re-emerges from behind the clouds.
4. The crash of something large falling through a tree's canopy shatters the air. A muffled thud heralds the thing reaching the ground. A falling rotten branch or the sound of a creature tumbling to the ground could be the cause of the sound.
5. Ants swarm about in the dead of the night, searching for food. If the characters have left food on the ground— even in packs—the ants carry away much of it to their nearby nest.
6. A constrictor snake slithers through the dark of the night, hunting for prey. The predator only attacks a halfling, gnome or similarly-sized companion animal.
7. Sudden snarls and whines erupt from some distance away. The noise wakes all but the heaviest sleepers. A ranger or druid can confirm that somewhere nearby two large animals battle to the death.
8. Soft rain falls upon the camp. The rain is persistent and reduces a guard's chance to hear or see anything approaching. By dawn, the rain has drenched anything or anyone not kept under cover.
9. The stars blaze, high above the jungle canopy. A perceptive guard notices something large pass in front of the stars. The creature heads in a random direction and does not investigate the camp.
10. A silent jet-black leopard pads into camp, hunting for food. Uninterested in large prey, it only attacks small humanoids or animals. It flees if injured.
11. Heavy rain deluges the camp for much of the night, turning the ground into a sticky, muddy morass. Only a robust tent provides good shelter from the deluge. By morning, deep puddles dot the camp. If the rain continues, travel is difficult and miserable.
12. Monkeys chatter incessantly in the trees near the camp, from early in the morning. They wake all but the heaviest sleeper. When the birds join in with their morning chorus, sleep becomes impossible. 





## WILDERNESS DRESSING 



1. A huge tree lies part-buried in the gloom of the jungle floor. Lichens, vines and smaller shrubs grow on the rotting trunk creating a living wall. The tree is over 100- foot long and over half its bulk has sunk into the earth.
2. Without warning, the party reach a deep gorge cutting across their path. A fast-flowing river fills the gorge. Nearby, the mouldering remains of a rope bridge span the gap. The bridge is not strong enough to support heavy travellers.
3. The ruin of a wooden hut stands in the gloom of a stand of trees atop a small rise. Deep shadows filled the tumbled and rotting hut. Rudimentary signs of agriculture suggest someone tried to make a (likely solitary) life here.
4. A pit—its floor laced with sharpened wooden stakes— straddles the trail. The corpse of a gorilla lies amid the splintered stakes. Investigation reveals the gorilla has been dead for only a day or so. (Whoever dug the pit may lurk nearby and won't take kindly to the characters making off with their catch.)
5. A tribal territory marker looms over the trail. Lurid and stylised cravings of nature spirits decorate the marker. Lichen and creepers obscure some of the carvings, suggesting it has been here for many years.
6. A rotting spear—of curious, but primitive design—lies tangled in a bush. The spear's tip comprises sharp, firehardened obsidian of the blackest hue.
7. The shattered bones of some long-ago traveller lie in the shadow of a large tree. The unfortunate's equipment has long ago rusted or rotted away. Investigating the bones reveals, that something powerful has feasted on the tasty marrow within.
8. A narrow, but deep, stream, flows from a rocky upland over a series of small waterfalls in a narrow gully. The stream is audible from some distance away, and the gully provides an excellent place to rest.
9. With little warning, the dense undergrowth gives way to a small stretch of savanna. The five-foot-high grass undulates in the breeze and a faint susurration fills the warm air.
10. A pile of skulls, weathered and bleached, stand in a vinechoked pyramid about six-foot high. The grinning skulls watch over the trail, providing—perhaps—a warning or serving as a boundary marker.
11. A crumbling statue of a cruel-faced man has part-sunken into the soft jungle soil. Digging out the bottom half of the statue reveals the man to have a snake's tail.
12. A huge ants' nest towers astride the trail and a multitude of large ants quest all about for food. If disturbed, the ants swarm from their nest to attack. 





## UNEVENTFUL TRAVEL 



1. The party slog through dense jungle, pierced only by occasional game trails. The heroes end the day hot, exhausted and hungry.
2. The day is hot and the terrain hard and unforgiving. The jungle is alive with the sounds of large animals. Luckily, the party encounter nothing dangerous.
3. Dark clouds scud across the sky before deluging the jungle (and party) with hot and heavy rain. The party get soaked and the ground turns into a sucking bog.
4. The party find a network of winding game trails threading through the dense jungle vegetation. This discovery speeds their movement. In the afternoon, the trails debouch into an arid plain.
5. The jungle is alive with the sounds of its innumerable denizens. The party see many animals and bird during the day; if they choose to hunt, they are more successful than normal and feast well when they rest.
6. The party make slow progress until they come to a driedup river leading in the general direction they wish to go. Following the river, they make good time for the rest of the day and easily find an agreeable campsite. 





# FORT ON THE BORDERLANDS 


## FORT DRESSINGS 



1. A lewd picture daubed on a wall depicts a warrior decapitating a goblin, orc or some other kind of evil humanoid. The blood spurting from the humanoid's neck is particularly overdone.
2. Recent rain has turned the churned earth of the courtyard into a muddy morass, through which travellers and men-at-arms struggle. A single boot juts forlornly from a patch of particularly thick, cloying mud.
3. A section of scorched, soot-blackened wall along with a newly replaced section of roof bears mute testimony to a bad fire that—perhaps—almost got out of control.
4. An empty gallows atop a five-foot-high wooden platform stands in the middle of the courtyard. Two servants are on their hands and knees scrubbing the platform clean. A bored man-at-arms stands nearby looking on.
5. A pile of barrels and crates stands against one wall. A large black and white cat lies curled atop one of the barrels, seemingly snoozing in the sun. Nearby, a mangy dog—practically on its belly—creeps toward its target.
6. One section of the keep's wall has been crudely whitewashed. Nails have been driven into the wall and from several flutter various notices. Most are weathered stained and unreadable.
7. A bedraggled man occupies a set of prominently placed stocks. Several wooden buc ket s s t and nearby full of rotting vegetables. A few children linger near the buckets daring each other to fling the vegetables at the man. As one of the children edges closer to a bucket, the man swears and curses at her.
8. A line of sparring dummies stands in the middle of the courtyard. Nearby, a small group of trainee men-ata rms c l u s t e r around a bin h o l d i n g w o o d e n practise swords.
9. A few stones have fallen from a wall, and lie scattered on the ground at its base. Crumbled mortar also dusts the ground and nearby a set of mason's tools stand propped against the wall.
10. A score or so starlings perch atop one of the fort's towers. If disturbed, they take to the air, circle the fort several times and then fly off singing loudly.
11. Faint, weatherworn graffiti mars one stone at the base of the wall. Scratched in humanity's Common tongue, it reads, “For his Glory.” It looks like someone has subsequently tried to scratch out the words, but that they gave up before managing to efface the message.
12. An empty, unattended wagon pulled up outside a nearby building sits lopsidedly in the mud. One of the wagon's wheels is missing. The wheel arch's wood is also splintered and broken. Clearly, the wagon has been in an accident.
13. Smoke rises from chimneys in several of the fort's towers. The air is preternaturally still today; the smoke lingers over the fort like a shroud and does not dissipate until the wind picks up.
14. Enticing smells wafting from the kitchen fill the air. Perhaps the lord plans a feast? Several small children and a few ragged beggars cluster near the kitchen door in anticipation of the scraps.
15. A portion of the outer wall near the front gate is scorched and blackened as if it has once been deluged in flaming oil or the like. (Inquiries reveal a roving band of three trolls attacked the fort last year, but the flaming oil convinced them to go elsewhere).
16. Wooden scaffolding encases one of the fort's towers; several workers—under a master mason's direction—work to repair pitted, weather-worn mortar. At the tower's base, a neat pile of dressed stone suggests the work will be extensive and last a considerable time.
17. The inn's windows are thrown wide to air out the interior. Blankets and rugs hang over several of the window cills. Periodically a servant appears at a window and vigorous beats the blankets and rugs.
18. The resounding clang of metal on metal—likely emanating from the blacksmith's forge—echoes through the air. It stops for a few moments, before starting up again even louder than before.
19. A wanted poster—depicting a head and shoulders drawing of a particularly ugly dwarf—is nailed to several doors throughout the fort. Apparently, the dwarf, one Durrim Jarbek, is wanted for crimes involving unwarranted groping and failure to pay one's debt at the local tavern. A reward of 10 gp is offered for his capture.
20. Extra guards are posted at the front gate. Visitors entering the fort are subjected to extensive searches and questioning before being granted admittance. No one seems to know the cause for the increased vigilance. 





## SIGHTS & SOUNDS 



1. The clamour of sword striking sword and the grunts of warriors fighting foreshadows the sight of two fighters practising their craft.
2. A particularly large raven squats on a tower's battlements and watches folks' coming and going with strange intensity. It flies off if the characters take particular note of its presence.
3. Dark clouds scud low across the sky, plunging the fort into shadow.
4. Several travellers—the mud of the road fresh upon their boots—stagger past the party in search of fresh ale, warm food and a comfortable bed for the night.
5. A small boy—dirty and thin—darts through the crowd. He clutches a scabbarded longsword to his chest. The weapon appears finely made. If stopped, the boy—Arthal —explains he is delivering it to a customer of his father.
6. A shout of alarm from one of the fort's towers has several men-at-arms rushing to investigate whatever their companion has spotted.
7. Two off-duty men-at-arms wearing nought but tunics and dirty tabards stagger along arm in arm. One waves a wineskin theatrically while singing a rather lewd song in a rich, baritone voice. The other seems to be on the verge of being sick.
8. A pair of large horses pull a huge, heavily laden, creaking wagon through the fort's gate. The wagon barely fits through the gate and its wheels scour deep groves in the muddy courtyard. A single man clad in a heavy cloak and wide-brimmed hat steers the horses with deft flicks of the reins.
9. A mailed messenger on horseback canters past the characters on her way to the gate. She wears a sheathed longsword on one hip and has a haversack full of scrolls and other missives slung over her shoulder. Her saddlebags bulge with supplies, suggesting she is starting a long journey.
10. A servant emerges from a tower carrying a chamber pot at arm's length. She climbs the steps to the outer wall and then—surreptitiously—dumps the pot's contents over the wall.
11. A flag flying from one of the fort's towers breaks free and drifts gently down to the ground. It lands in a particularly large patch of horse manure. Is this an omen for the fort's fortunes?
12. A mailed warrior walks a huge hound. The dog amiably trots along behind its master…until it catches the scent of something interesting in the air. Nearby, a cat breaks from cover and darts off. A few seconds later, the dog bursts into action and gives chase leaving the warrior—shouting loudly and impotently—alone.
13. A sudden gust of wind catches the fort's various flags and pennants—they stream out proudly before the wind drops again.
14. Laughter and singing float through an open window. It sounds like the people inside are in excellent spirits.
15. A patrol of muddy, tired men-at-arms returns to the keep after spending three days patrolling the local roads. Led by a mounted officer, the men make their way directly to the barracks. They desire food and ale; anyone who gets in their way—perhaps an adventurer asking irritating questions about their patrol—is likely to get short shrift.
16. A cowled figure lurks in a shadowy doorway, seemingly watching the characters. If accosted, the man protests his innocence maintaining he was merely lost in thought.
17. A wagon stacked high with firewood harvested from the surrounds stands near the fort's kitchens. Three servants are busy unpacking the wood and stacking it in a nearby crude wood store.
18. A peasant and his daughter drive a half-dozen sheep into the courtyard; two barking dogs dart about the small flock keeping it together. If asked, the peasants explain the sheep are destined for slaughter and then the kitchens.
19. It is time for the changing of the guard. For a brief period, there are twice as many men-at-arms on the walls and at the front gate as normal. Half an hour after the watch changes, the tavern gets unsurprisingly busy.
20. A young child of indeterminate age and sex chases a mangy dog grasping a short length of rope in its mouth. Totally engrossed in their chase game, neither notice the approach of a heavily laden wagon… 





## WHISPERS & RUMOURS 



1. Strange things are going on at the chapel. A hooded figure has been seen entering the building late at night. (The priest is having an affair with a married woman).
2. The fire at the blacksmith's last month was not an accident. Had it not been for his apprentice's quick thinking, the whole building would have gone up in smoke and flame.
3. Bandits have once again been seen in the fort's vicinity. Rumour has it that the Captain of the Guard is preparing an expedition to put them to the sword.
4. The fort's lord is expecting a high-ranking guest in the next few days. He has already dispatched a patrol to meet the guest and preparations to receive a person of note have kept the servants busy for a week. Speculation runs rampant as to exactly who is coming to visit.
5. Someone has dared to steal an entire pig carcass from the keep's kitchens. When the thief is found, there will be hell to pay.
6. The Company of the Cloven Shield—an adventuring band of minor repute—visited the fort last month. They had a map of the surrounding wilderness and one of them—while deep in his cups— boasted the map showed the site of a lost treasure. The company hasn't been seen since they left the fort three weeks ago. Most people think they have perished.
7. The castle is haunted. A couple of years ago, an evil necromancer was burned at the stake in the courtyard. With his dying screams, he cursed all those present to never rest easy in the grave. Since then, several graves have been disturbed and the corpses removed (or did they escape under their own power?)
8. The well providing drinking water for the fort is old—far older than the fort itself. Writings attributed to the original settlers of the area speak of caverns accessible from the well shaft. However, no such access now exists; one of the previous lords had the whole well re-bricked blocking any such entrances.
9. Strange tracks have been found by hunters in the surrounding area. Judging by the size of the tracks, whatever made them was roughly the size of a horse, and—worryingly—it has claws!
10. The tavern is infested with bedbugs—I wouldn't stay there if I were you! 





## MEN-AT-ARMS WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Aevar (LG male human fighter 1): Overly burly, and bald, Aevar cuts a menacing image. His dangerous mien is further enhanced by a badly done tattoo of a skull covering his entire head except for his face. For all that, Aevar is loyal to his lord, if not a little bit too enthusiastic in combat.
2. Turkka Hirvonen (N male human fighter 1): Turkka doesn't want to be a soldier; he only became one to escape a life of crushing poverty and constant hunger. He is loyal—to an extent—to his lord, but is always on the lookout for a way to turn a profit. Turkka is always hungry and rarely encountered without food in his hand (or hidden in his pouch).
3. Aila Leino (NG female human fighter 3): Aila's slender frame belies a strength far greater than most men. Friendly and gregarious, Aila is popular with her fellows, although secretly she hates their coarse, unsubtle humour. She is a skilled warrior and braver than most veterans. With dark grey eyes and short-cropped red hair, Aila stands out from her drab fellows. If she can escape this backwater fort, a great destiny lies in her future for Aila is not entirely human...
4. Gar Blood-Eye (CN male half-orc fighter 2): A renegade from an orc tribe lurking in the nearby wilderland, Gar is not completely trusted by his fellows. Half of them see the tall, broad-shouldered green-skinned warrior as little more than a savage while most of the rest believe he is a spy. Consequently, Gar has few friends and has become used to expecting the worst from those he meets.
5. Myev Widow-Maker (NG female half-orc fighter 2): A terror on the battlefield, Myers has a way of looking at people that suggests she is plotting their brutal and swift evisceration. She uses a double-blade axe—her “Widow-maker”—in lieu of any other weapon. For all that, she is popular with her fellows who have got over her strange ways. She—in turn—is incredibly protective of them.
6. Arnallae Uthliavar (CG female half-elf fighter 3): Arnallae is a restless soul who has served here for a decade or so because she wants to experience the borderland and its perils. She is erratic but brave. While Arnallae would never put the lives of her fellows in jeopardy, she is easily distracted.
7. Eohric Llitwin (CN old male human fighter 2): Stocky and grey-haired, Eohric is clearly older than his fellows— who jokingly refer to him as “grandfather”. Eohric is immensely experienced but now tires easily. He dreams of retiring and living out his days in a tavern, but Eohric is an inveterate gambler. Disastrously, he is also gullible and heavily in debt to certain individuals who want access to his lord's private chambers. Thus far, Eohric has resisted their advances but as his debts mount he is becoming increasingly desperate.
8. Valto Sianio (N male human fighter 1): Valto suffers from chronic toothache. With a perpetual grimace on his face, he appears miserable much of the time. Valto's woes started when he was punched in the face during a training bout. The blow shattered his front teeth and infection soon set in. Now all that remains of his teeth are blackened stumps.
9. Gerold Corbie (NE male human thief 3): Ostensibly Gerold is a new recruit to the garrison, but he has a secret. Gerald is a spy for a rival lord (or perhaps a band of humanoid planning to attack the fort). Unfortunately for Gerold, one of the characters fits the description of his contact (whom he has never met before) and he tries to make contact one night in the tavern. Confusion ensues; if he can talk his way out of his encounter with the character, he abandons his mission and flees.
10. Frida Gall (NG female human fighter 1): Constantly on the edge of exhaustion, Frida has deep bags under her eyes. Bedevilled by nightmares, she rarely sleeps a whole night through and often wakes up screaming. She is not a popular bunkmate, consequently. Desperate for sleep, she has tried all manner of herbal remedies and the faint smell of such often hangs in the air around her. 





## TRAVELLERS WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Ahualhar Hafeltyrr (NG male elf fighter 4): A bowyer and fletcher in search of work, Ahualhar has come to the fort after hearing rumours the lord is a keen archer. This tall, slender elf carries a beautifully crafted longbow and leads a donkey whose saddlebags are stuffed full of arrows and the tools of his trade. Perhaps, a few arrows are magical or otherwise exceptional; they might even be for sale.
2. Jarani Darzak (LN female dwarf fighter 2): A skilled stonemason—and equally skilled drinker—Jarani is at the fort to bid on some repair work. While waiting to see the lord, she spends her time either in the tavern or poking about the fortifications. She's got into several rows with guards who have stopped her accessing certain parts of the fortress and—as a result—is in a foul mood.
3. Ossi Eskola (CN male human thief 2): Fleeing extensive debts in his home town, portly Ossi has come to the fort to lose himself. Still dressed in his finest—travel-stained— robes Ossi's purse grows light and he has begun to belatedly realise he has no long-term plan. Seeing the characters as a potential source of wealth he tries to ingratiate himself with the party—offering to act as their intermediary in trade matters and so forth.
4. Varma Keto (NG female human): Varma is a cook—a good one by all accounts—without an employer. She has fled to the borderlands after her last employer and his whole family died of food poisoning (or perhaps just poisoning as the rumours suggest). She is guiltless of any foul doings but has no way of proving her innocence. Coming to the end of her funds, she is getting desperate.
5. Marra Sharpeye (NG middle-aged female halfling fighter 1/thief 2): Marra is a mother on a mission. Her son —Kallon Sharpeye—was last heard of at the fort with a band of adventurers. They disappeared into the wilderness six months ago and have not been heard of since. A retired adventurer herself, she is frantic with worry and is only a few sleepless nights away from striking out alone in search of her son.
6. Alaric (CN young male human): This scrawny, dirty urchin came to the fort with a merchant caravan. The caravan moved on without him—Alaric was stealing food from the kitchens at the time—and is now trapped here. With no friends and no resources to speak of, he has been alternately stealing from, or relying on the kindness of, strangers.
7. Pinafen Barrick (NE male gnome thief 6): Pinafen might look like a kindly scribe for hire, but he isn't. Pinafen is a serial murderer whose black, twisted heart knows neither mercy nor pity. He stalks the borderlands, moving from community to community and leaves a trail of hideously mutilated bodies in his wake. If the characters are leaving—but not plunging into the wilderness—he tries to travel with them (for “protection”).
8. Ishild Salii (N female human): A singer of minor renown, Ishild cuts a striking figure in her costume. Offstage, she is shy, but on stage, she has a captivating presence. Often besieged by male admirers she hates the attention and hates even more asking for payment for her singing. Thus, she is perpetually in need of funds. Ideally, she'd like a wealthy patron…
9. Jarel Dellode (N male dwarf): Jarel is headstrong, certain of his own brilliance—in all manner of professions and skills—and also spectacularly misplaced in his confidence. Nothing is ever Jarel's fault and he often proves he is right by shouting louder than the other person. He has come to the fort because several of the businesses here owe him money (as he sees it). The aforementioned businesses see it another way— everything he has supplied them has been either substandard or has fallen apart almost immediately.
10. Firatis Rumnaleir (LG female elf magic-user 5): Firatis is a minor wizard and skilled teacher. She has been engaged to teach the children of the wealthy folk at the fort. She spends much of her time teaching and much of the rest of the time resting or reading in her rooms at the inn. Sometimes—when the mood takes her—she wanders the fort's surroundings. Like many of her race, she can move stealthily and has thus far avoided contact with the region's monstrous denizens. 





# GHOSTLY HAUNTINGS 


## GHOSTLY ADVENTURERS 

1. AADAM TOIVAS, THE LAST GUARDIAN LG male human ghost (in life, paladin 7) Detecting Aadam's Presence: A feeling of safety pervades Aadam's Tower, making any who visit feel well-protected and secure. A slight glow, which pushes back the darkness, emanates from Aadam's bardiche. His incessant chanting can be heard within the tower itself, along with the sound of his armour scraping against itself as Aadam ceaselessly patrols the keep. On mid-winter's day, shadowy demons assault his tower, and Aadam fights furiously to beat them back. Aadam and the demons are readily visible in the moonlight as his heroic actions of centuries past are replayed for all to see. This ageing warrior wears battered, archaic plate armour and wields a fearsome bardiche. Although short, he exudes an aura of power and moves effortlessly despite his heavy armour and bulky weapon. His lips move constantly, and the cadence of a chant can be heard from all around, although specific words are impossible to discern. A symbol of the Lord Protector adorns his breastplate. Aadam Toivas protects his home from any intrusion of evil. His vigil is unceasing. Personality: Honest, almost to the point of rudeness, Aadam speaks of things as he sees them. He feels responsible for any goodly creatures, particularly within his tower, and defends them against any threat. Stoic in the extreme, Aadam does not bemoan his fate and instead thanks his lord for the opportunity to continue to serve. He forever patrols the structure bearing his name, seeking threats to defeat and innocents to protect. Mannerisms: Aadam's gait is that of a soldier. He marches through his tower, investigating the slightest thing left out of place. He tends to scratch his chin when thinking, and to pick his nose if no-one is looking—bad habits in life that haven't left him in death. Dawn and dusk find him on his knees in the tower's shrine, offering prayers to his Lord. Rest in Peace: Local rumour suggests Aadam will finally rest if the forces assaulting his tower each year ever win; this might be true if the mid-winter battle was anything more than a recreation of events gone by. In truth, his dedication to the Lord Protector ties Aadam to the tower. Should the tower, or the shrine within, be destroyed, Aadam takes it as a sign he is no longer needed, and his spirit goes to its final rest.
2. ANTERO JOUTSI LE male human ghost (in life, thief 3) Detecting Antero Joutsi's Presence: Generally seen as a tall skeleton figure with a revolving head that can see in all directions, Antero drives a spectral cart carrying a glowing coffin. Four ghostly figures accompany him. This tall skeleton's head revolves in a complete circle so that it can look all around. Antero Joutsi terrorised the local common folk, often stealing to fund his boisterous lifestyle, which generally involved excessive drinking, gambling, brawling and vice. He also went on a successful adventure to find an evil wizard. His proud boast was that he had slain a “dragon”, actually a wizard's pseudodragon familiar, while the rest of the adventuring party slew the wizard. When he returned from his great adventure, he was arrested and framed for the murder of Inga, a local farmer's daughter with whom he had fallen in love. In a short trial, he was found guilty by a jury of 12 locals and was quickly unceremoniously hung by the neck until dead. It was fortunate (for him) that Antero was hung on the last day of the year, as the country's final person to die every year is offered the chance to return to “life” by becoming “the Dead Prince”. The Dead Prince's duties include carrying away the bodies of evil folk when they die. Antero seeks attention by tapping on a door or mournfully wailing like a banshee. When the evildoer dies, Antero's helpers lift the physical body and its soul into the coffin and carry them away. As well as his duties as the Dead Prince, Antero can sometimes be seen near a lake consoling Inga's spirit, especially on clear, dark nights just before dawn. Personality: Being at heart more of a coward than he cares to admit, Antero follows any evil character he knows will get into trouble. He only appears when the evildoer is at death's door. Mannerisms: Antero has no time for good-aligned folk, preferring if nobody will die soon to follow and occasionally protect those who live the high life. Rest in Peace: Antero can rest in peace if he performs his duties for a year and a day. Antero is always seeking revenge on the local townsfolk who convicted him and clings to the hope that if he can arrange their deaths while he is the Dead Prince he may be able to return both himself and Inga to life. 
3. EEVA SEPPO, THE GLENMOTHER NG female human ghost (in life, druid 9) Detecting Eeva's Presence: Attentive watchers might see a swirl of loose leaves, dust or sand moving against the wind. Plants seem more vibrant and subtly reach towards her. Seeds—even those in backpacks, sacks and pouches—also begin to grow, splitting open to reveal bright green shoots. The scent of spring blossoms fills the air when Eeva is near. The apparition wears a simple brown habit over her slight frame and uses a simple stave to support herself as she walks. Long grey hair flows freely down her back, framing a wizened and kindly face. She holds a willow basket, full of seeds and bulbs, in her free hand. She reaches in and selects a few kernels by rolling them between her fingers before casting them about seemingly at random; green shoots spring forth as the seeds take root. Eeva Seppo nurtures her beloved woods and eschews violence no matter the provocation. Personality: The Glenmother is known to be both kind and nurturing; more than once, she has returned a lost child home from her woods. As a pacifist, Eeva is highly protective of her home, using powerful druidic magic to turn away without combat those not welcome. Eeva's eyes reveal her sadness, as she can no longer feel the land as she once did. Mannerisms: A druid in life, Eeva is constantly planting new seeds in her woods or caring for its trees and plants. She wears a near-constant smile, but never talks, preferring to let her actions speak for her. If addressed, Eeva simply stands or sits patiently, nodding along as she listens, before directing or showing the speaker along the path she thinks will most likely aid them. Rest in Peace: Eeva gave her life to the woods and entombed her own body inside a mighty oak when her death was near. If this tree can be found and destroyed, the Glenmother loses her anchor to this world. Eeva is aware of this and protects (without using violence) this tree above all others. She also knows that should she possess a powerful enough animal, she may be forever lost in that form. She fears she might lose control of her new body and become a threat to the land she cherishes.
4. MARTTA KARI CE female human ghost (in life, fighter 6/thief 3/bard 4) Detecting Martta's Presence: Appearing as a young lady dressed in a fitted black dress, Martta lingers around the Prying Eyes river tavern. She often leads patrons to an old rickety bridge nearby. When they fall from it—after she possesses them—she leads them to their untimely demise somewhere in the nearby dismal, boggy swampland. This beautiful, but stern, woman wears a fitted black dress and a white shawl about her slender, bony shoulders. Martta Kari performed many times at the Tivoli—a well regarded local theatre. She was also the well-known owner of the Prying Eyes tavern (where she also performed nightly). She, however, was secretly working with a gang of river pirates called the Patseys. She passed on information about her customers, many of whom were killed in the swamp after the Patseys robbed them. However, the river gang didn't know the swamp was cursed by an evil warlock, only finding out when their victims' animate bodies staggered and squelched out from the marsh. In an orgy of violence, all the river pirates were soon dead. However, they also returned as undead and used Martta to entice yet more unfortunate creatures to their deaths in the swamp. Being the adventurous sort, Martta wanted to sell her tavern to new owners and move on. Unfortunately, she made the fatal mistake of seducing a local paladin working for the local lord. She accidentally revealed the location of the Patseys hideout. The result was inevitable; she was arrested and sentenced to death. Her body was buried in an unmarked grave close to the inn, but the cursed swamp grew, swallowed up her grave, and awoke her restless, blackhearted spirit. Personality: Martta always appears willing and able to perform for any character or party that stops for the night or stays until late at the Prying Eyes. Mannerisms: Martta always appears charming. She is of great assistance to any evil character staying at the Prying Eyes in the hopes they help her lure yet another group of victims to their doom in the swamp. Rest in Peace: Martta will rest if she can find a way to dispel the swamp's ancient curse. She needs minions—or fools—to help her. Lifting the curse releases her spirit. 





## GHOSTLY VILLAINS 

1. FELJIN TOPPLEDEPPLE, EATER OF GOLD CE male gnome ghost (in life, thief 4) Detecting Feljin's Presence: From a distance, comes the harsh clack of metal striking stone—the sound of Feljin hard at work searching for his beloved gold. When he gets closer, any nearby gold begins to emit tiny golden particles that float towards his pouch; any gold touched by Feljin immediately evaporates into a golden mist and flows swiftly into his pouch. The eyes of this ghostly gnome dart to and fro, madness obvious within. A crown of molten gold partially covers his head and face, and terrible burn scars are visible across much of the rest of his body. He wears a large blackened pouch at his side, from which comes the clink of coins. Feljin Toppledepple covets gold in all its forms. Personality: Avaricious beyond the comprehension of most living creatures, Feljin covets anything golden. He will do anything to procure more, first through trickery and then by force if necessary. Focused entirely on the procurement of gold, Feljin is oblivious to all else and may be easily tricked by clever adventurers. Should he become aware of such trickery, Feljin relentlessly attacks those he sees as foes. Mannerisms: Feljin slurs his words through ruined lips and peers short-sightedly at whoever has his attention. He absent-mindlessly rubs his awful burns, leaving small flakes of ghostly skin behind as he staggers about. His free hand often drops to his pouch, stroking it lovingly. Should a character offer the ghostly miner gold, the gnome offers a gem in exchange. He promises more gems for more gold. Rest in Peace: Feljin died a terrible death; such was his obsession with gold he tried to rob a vault by setting it on fire before breaking into the burning building. He died covered in molten gold. Now gold sustains him, and Feljin slowly wastes away if prevented from feeding upon it. Legends say placing fool's gold in his pouch will disperse his spirit. The pouch itself remains should he be destroyed; it is a cursed thing that devours anything placed within.
2. HANNU LAINE LE male human ghost (in life, fighter 5) Detecting Hannu's Presence: The smell of sea salt and the creaking of cordage grows steadily louder as Hannu approaches. In his presence, pearls glow with a dim glow. Wrapped in glowing green mist, this male human wears a green tricorne with a blue-green peacock feather, a dark green waistcoat and dark green pantaloons. His grizzled face is a mass of scars and cuts. A necklace of golden pearls hangs around his neck. Hannu Laine captained the dread pirate ship, Royal Swan. Killed in battle by cannon fire, Hannu could not bear to be separated from his beloved treasure—especially his fine pearls. His last wish was to be buried at sea with as much of his hoard as possible. His loyal crew wrapped his body in one of the ship's sails together with some of his most valuable pearls, weighed him down with cannonballs and threw him overboard in deep water. Royal Swan was captured soon after that, and its crew executed. Hannu's treasure or his body have never been found. Since his death, Hannu has sought to recover all his remaining treasure, using many different creatures to help him. If a character by some misfortune comes into possession of one of Hannu's missing pearls, the ghostly captain tries to retrieve it. His hauntings can drive his target mad. Once possessed, a character tries to return the item to Hannu's hoard before being forced to collect more treasure, particularly pearls, for him. Personality: Forthright and aggressive, Hannu exploits the weakness of anyone possessing one of his pearls. Hannu hates cowards and respects strength, regarding his pearls as an instrument to slay the weak and the source of his power. Mannerisms: Hannu hates any character that drinks any form of alcohol. He is always seen fondling his pearl necklace and looks as though he still means business. However, Hannu can be kind to the strong, perhaps helping out in a fight or passing a tiny pearl to a brave character to complete a vital trade or gain a new treasure for his treasure hoard. Rest in Peace: Hannu only rests in peace if a possessed character becomes captain of their own pirate ship. He then leaves forever, merely asking the ship be named Royal Swan.
3. HURR DAG, TERROR IN THE DARK NE female bugbear ghost (in life, assassin 4) Detecting Hurr's Presence: In Hurr Dag's vicinity, it feels as if something malevolent is watching and waiting to pounce. Shadows move of their own volition. A smell not unlike charred rubber burns the inside of a character's nose and sticks in their throat, and the hairs on the back of their neck rise. If examined closely, the ring to which Hurr Dag is bound seems to flicker with an inner fire. It burns brighter as Hurr Dag gets hungrier. Eight feet tall, with a build to match, this ghostly bugbear wears leathery hides. Her glowing crimson eyes pierce the darkness from above yellowed teeth. She grips an umbral axe tightly in her fist. Shrunken heads hang from her belt, expressions of horror forever etched on their faces. Hurr Dag looms over her prey, enjoying the fear and terror her appearance often creates. Personality: Hurr Dag is spiteful and cruel, literally feeding on her preys' fear. She loathes elves most of all and always predates upon them, first seeking revenge for her death. Any conversation with Hurr Dag is fraught, as she becomes aggressive at the slightest provocation. Mannerisms: Hurr Dag prefers to approach those who sleep, filling their slumber with nightmares before they awaken with her standing over them. The villainess then leaves, returning each night, filling her victim with growing dread. Given the chance, Hurr Dag avoids combat as she prefers the chase and feast upon the fear she generates. Tied to the cursed ring she stole from an elven princess, she makes life a living hell for its wearer. Hurr Dag rarely enters conversation, but when she does she smacks her lips, as if savouring the taste of terror on the air. Her fist tightens on her axe at every movement, and her eyes constantly flicker to the sides, alert to any threat. Rest in Peace: Hurr Dag is bound to a cursed magical amethyst ring of elven manufacture, forced to remain close by forever. Should the ring be placed in an elven forge and struck with an elven hammer, it shatters, and Hurr will be exorcised. Stories persist, however, that breaking the ring any other way might give her even greater powers.
4. TOMMO HIRVI NE male human ghost (in life, ex-paladin 9) Detecting Tommo's Presence: Tommo appears after a bloody fight in which no mercy was asked for or given. Often, he appears with a group of fiends come to remove the dead. Sometimes he is seen carrying the slain into the demiplane surrounding his fiendish mausoleum, where few dare enter and from where nobody has returned to tell the tale. Tommo fought in many battles against the force of evil. However, he finally met his match when a succubus seduced him hours before a climactic battle. Although the forces of good won the battle, Tommi unhesitatingly sacrificed several of his unsuspecting comrades to pursue his new evil goals. His oldest retainer struck him down when his perfidy was revealed. Most folk supposed he died honourably on the battlefield; all who know the truth are now dead. After the battle, the local lord built an elaborate mausoleum to honour the dead and remember Tommo's deeds. There, Tommo attracted more and more of his demonic friends by committing atrocities amongst the living and spreading fear among the locals. Such was the horror and inedible evil of Tommo's deeds that the mausoleum and its surroundings were drawn into their own shadowy demiplane. Anyone entering the demiplane finds it challenging to find the mausoleum, as it shifts from place to place among the blasted landscape. This ghostly, armoured warrior clutches a glowing scarlet longsword and a black shield emblazoned with a glowing scarlet skull and crossbones. Personality: Tommo continues to pursue evil for the sake of it, but has memories of his former life and service to the forces of good. He is growing tired of his new allies and is interested in discovering how to atone for his evil deeds. Tommo can appear to be solid and mortal. He is a charming conversationalist. He could work with the party to clear out an infestation of undead or even greater evil, as long as he thinks the characters can also help him. Mannerisms: Tommo dislikes any character showing indecision; he prefers impulsive chaotic good or evil-aligned characters. Tommo has a wild temper and exhibits poltergeist-like behaviour to scare anyone who doesn't meet his standards. If he really hates somebody, he lures them into his misty demiplane. Rest in Peace: For Tommo to rest in peace, he must succeed in a grand quest to atone for his evil deeds.
5. VILUTAR TORNIA LE female human ghost (in life, wizard 17) Detecting Vilutar's Presence: Vilutar searches for adventurers to help her and is not tied to any one location. She favours lurking in laboratories, libraries and the studies of powerful mages. She mutters to herself incessantly, and adventurers likely first hear her before she comes into view. Depending on her apparent age when the characters encounter her she could be shuffling, walking or skipping. She is not initially hostile, but defends herself vigorously and fearlessly—after all, she knows she cannot die. Wisps of glimmering multi-coloured mist swirl around this translucent woman. The woman's visage changes—growing subtly older before your very eyes—as she approaches. Vilutar hunts incessantly for an end to her cursed existence. A powerful wizard in life, Vilutar was on the cusp of discovering the secret to lichdom when old age claimed her. With her dying breath, she cursed time itself, and time heard her. Now, trapped in a perpetual daily cycle of youth, middle-age and (temporary) death Vilutar is desperate to escape her predicament. She needs help, though, and woe betide any adventurer daring to refuse her demands for assistance. Personality: Vilutar is arrogant and believes she can defeat time. Supremely powerful as a wizard she commands respect and obedience from all those she encounters. If she does not get what she desires, she flies into a terrible rage. For all that, though, Vilutar is a woman of her word. She offers great wealth and power to anyone who will retrieve certain objects she requires to “lift her curse immemorial.” Mannerisms: Vilutar refers to herself in the third person— which can be tremendously irritating. Her voice changes as she grows older, and she enjoys over-doing the effects of the ageing process upon her body. She wails, she screams and she moves increasingly slowly and haltingly as time exacts its daily revenge upon her. Rest in Peace: Vilutar has discovered she can escape her curse by completing the process which will transform her into a lich. Unbeknownst to her, the formula she is researching will interact with her curse and actually transform her into a ghost-lich—a new form of powerful undead which will enjoy the benefits of both forms. 











# GOBLIN LAIR 


## GOBLINS WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Lipless Rord: His lips are just fine; the nickname comes from the jagged scar across his throat that prevents him from speaking louder than a whisper.
2. Ghalga Many-Whelps: This matronly goblin is never without at least four of her babes in tow; she teaches her children how to fight by throwing them at enemies.
3. Purg Pie Rat: Wearing a black tai-corn hat, with a skull hastily drawn on in chalk, and fighting with two meat hooks he holds in his hands, this goblin fancies himself a pirate, but is only really interested in plundering pastries.
4. Fongoa Stranglesgood: This goblin has over-long arms which hang down to her knees, and oversized hands. She kisses her victims just as they die, attempting to steal their last breath.
5. Lork: Having once heard the saying, “If you can't see me, I can't see you,” his solution to danger is to clap his hands over his eyes and scuttle off in a random direction.
6. Urbla Stewmaker: Her ability to use fire to cook food instead of burning it makes her a gourmet cook by goblin standards. She chops up the bodies of friend and foe alike after battle to cook in her “lovely” stews.
7. Borgo Dagger-Eye: This goblin has a horrific injury: the hilt of a dagger protrudes from his right eye, the result of a horrific knife-throwing accident. He has never removed the dagger, as he believes doing so will kill him. His preferred weapon remains the throwing knife.
8. Zingers Mudlover: Having loved wallowing in mud since she was a little whelp, once Zingers learned being covered head to toe in the stuff makes her blend in better to her swampy surroundings, she has almost never been without the stuff.
9. Kibzunk the Licker: While this goblin was named primarily for his love of licking random objects, he is also a metaphorical bootlicker, quick to provide sycophantic praise to the strongest person in sight.
10. Grout Hobwitch: This grizzled, ancient goblin is renowned for her knowledge of goblin magic, which mainly involves dubious curses and vague parables. She wears a belt of shrunken heads, and keeps a rat in a cage which she claims is her familiar.

20. A collection of well‐polished animal and bird talons made into a bracelet. 





## 1,000 ABNORMAL GOBLINS 


### GOBLIN DESCRIPTION

1. One of the goblin's ears has been chewed off; only a bloody stump remains.
2. Clad in a mish-mash of gaudily-coloured clothes, this goblin looks like a court jester or a motley fool.
3. This goblin wears a bone necklace of many finger and toe bones. They clack as the creature moves about.
4. Wearing leather armour, this goblin is festooned with belts and buckles. Many small pouches—all tightly cinched shut—hang from the belts.
5. Clad in a black robe, hacked off to fit and cinched at the waist with an oversized belt, this goblin has the air of the macabre about it. The cloak has a cowl in which holes have been cut for the creature's oversized ears.
6. Rotting teeth fill this pathetically thin goblin's mouth.
7. Oozing lesions cover this goblin's face.
8. Half of this goblin's hair has been burnt away; streaks of puckered scars cover its face.
9. This goblin wears a red patch over its left eye. Investigation reveals the eyepatch was coloured with blood; the eye beneath has been gouged out.
10. Naked but for a filthy loincloth, crude tattoos cover this goblin's scrawny body. The tattoos—an elf's severed head, a big axe and so on—are basic and poorly done. 

### COMBAT & TACTICS 



1. This goblin hurls rocks at archer-types and spellcasters. Every time she hits, she screeches “Boom!” in Goblin.
2. An utter coward, this goblin screams and runs away as soon as anyone tries to attack him.
3. Terrified of injury, this goblin retreats, if injured.
4. Drunk, this goblin is practically fearless. It charges into combat screaming in a high-pitched voice.
5. This goblin suffers from delusions of grandeur. At the start of combat, it hangs back and shouts commands to its comrades (which they ignore).
6. This goblin is convinced of its battle prowess. Before battle, it challenges the toughest-looking enemy to single combat. Honourable—for a goblin— it doesn't cheat (that much) and fights to the death.
7. Obsessed with fire, this goblin loves to fight with blazing weapons. If given the chance, it coats its weapons in oil before setting them aflame and charging. Scorch marks cover the goblin's hands and forearms.
8. Charging into battle, the goblin drops its weapon and tries to tackle its opponent to the ground. If successful, it whips out a dagger and starts stabbing.
9. More cunning than its fellows, this goblin tries to sneak around the back to engage weaker targets.
10. Obsessed with shiny treasure, this goblin stops fighting to loot downed opponents. 

### TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. This goblin carries a small pouch crammed full of smoked meat. Beyond all expectations, the meat is smoked correctly, tasty and safe.
2. A leather necklace hangs around the goblin's neck. From it hangs an iron holy symbol of a well-known goodaligned god. A small black stone—an onyx—set in the symbol is worth 5 gp.
3. This goblin hides its greatest treasure in its left boot—a tarnished gold piece stolen long ago from the chieftain. Only exhaustive searching reveals this hidden treasure.
4. Three vials of oil, already set with small makeshift wicks of ripped cloth fill this goblin's pouch.
5. The goblin's belt has an ornate, but tarnished, iron belt buckle depicting a dragon's maw. It is worth 1 gp.
6. An impressive collection of smooth, shiny pebbles fills this heavy pouch. The stones are worthless, but hidden among them is a small chunk of quartz worth 4 gp.
7. Carried in its pack, this goblin owns a short, 20-foot-long strip of dirty silk rope. The rope is in good condition.
8. This goblin has a wolf-skin hat. Sized for a small creature, it is warm but filthy. If clean, it is worth 5 sp.
9. The goblin's pouch holds a battered small iron box containing a small quantity of pungent, but soiled snuff.
10. Jet black fur edges this goblin's dirty scarlet cloak. The cloak once belonged to a goblin hero. It is a status symbol among the goblins. If given the chance a goblin tries to buy—or steal—the cloak. 





## WHAT' S THE GOBLIN DOING?

2. Shirking their duties (drinking, gambling, sleeping etc.)
3. Carrying water
4. Disposing of rubbish
5. Escorting a prisoner
6. Watching for intruders
7. Chasing an escaped slave or prisoner
8. Repairing something such as a door, weapon etc.

19. Nefariously sneaking about
20. Making a lot of noise—perhaps shouting or singing 

### MINOR RANDOM ENCOUNTERS 



1. The characters hear whistling from the direction they are heading. A few moments later, a goblin female carrying an empty water jug wanders around the corner. If she gets the chance, she screams, hurls the jug at the nearest intruder's head and then flees.
2. As #1 but the female has a young child with her. She screams for help and tries to hold off the characters while her child escapes to raise the alarm.
3. The characters discover a goblin scratching some graffiti into the wall with a sharp stone. The goblin has not noticed them. Investigations reveal the goblin is writing derogatory comments about the tribe's chief.
4. These two young warriors have stolen a flask of watery wine and are enjoying it somewhere out of the way. They are drunk.
5. The characters interrupt two goblins brawling. Totally caught up in their own fight, they have not heard the characters' approach.
6. Suddenly the sound of many goblins chanting a battle song reaches the party's ears. After a few ragged verses, the singing fades away.
7. Two goblins each drag a sack of rubbish toward the entrance. At the sight of the characters, they drop the sacks and flee. The rubbish spills onto the floor creating an area of difficult, slippery (and smelly) terrain.
8. Two goblin children have cornered a rat and are poking at it with sharp sticks. Their rapacious cries betray their presence before the characters stumble into view. If left to their own devices, they quickly kill the rat and begin skinning it.
9. Two goblins have sneaked off for some “quiet time” together. Lost in each other's company, they are completely oblivious to the characters.
10. This goblin is lurking in the hopes of catching and killing his rival. The characters' arrival gives him an idea. He offers to give them information on the layout of the lair, where the guards are and so, if they promise to kill his enemy (a particularly large goblin who always wears a black hood and carries a wickedly notched sword). 





## OUTSIDE A GOBLIN LAIR 



1. Yellowing bones are tied to the branches of a stunted bush growing nearby the entrance to the tribe's lair. Tied onto the bush with ribbons, bits of twine and thin strips of leather the bones clack together in the breeze.
2. A gallimaufry of tracks mars the ground. Scraps of broken equipment lie scattered about.
3. Scorch marks mar several trees in the immediate vicinity (showing where the goblins have practised with fire).
4. A deep, wide fire pit has been dug into the ground a score of paces from the entrance tunnel. Ash and fragments of burnt wood fill the hole and on windy days, the ash fills the air like a fine mist. Inquisitive characters also find bones of several animals (probably horses or ponies and suchlike) buried amongst the ash.
5. A fallen tree lies across the obvious trail leading to the goblin lair. Perceptive characters can spot the tell-tell signs of tracks behind the tree, suggesting the goblins sometimes keep watch here for intruders.
6. A rudimentary campsite lies amid a small stand of trees filling a nearby hollow. The slashed and bloody remains of several tents still flap listlessly in the breeze. Nothing of value remains at the site, which appears to be at least several months old.
7. Crude paintings of humanoids with big ears carrying wicked knives and serrated swords decorate several boulders. The artwork is simplistic at best.
8. About 100-foot from the lair, the beginnings of a pit block the trail where it passes between two large boulders. Nearby are cut tree branches and a pile of leaves (or other suitable camouflage) destined to cover the pit when it is finished. The pit is only about three-foot deep when discovered.
9. A mouldering goblin corpse lies on its front, partially hidden from view. A serrated dagger juts from its back. The corpse has been comprehensively looted of all valuables—even its shoes have been stolen—but the killer could not remove the dagger as it's tightly wedged between two bones.
10. A large tree—much bigger than its companions—looms over the approaches to the lair. Perceptive characters spot a knotted rope hanging down from its trunk and a small (currently unoccupied) observation platform built high up amid its branches. Is it the breeze making the knotted rope sway gently or has a goblin sentry recently rushed to warn the tribe of the party's approach? 

## GUARD ROOM DRESSING 



1. A battered table stands in roughly the centre of the chamber. Its legs have been haphazardly hacked off to suit the goblins' size. The two benches have been treated in a similar fashion, but one of them stands at a distinct angle. The remains of a meal and several wineskins lie scattered across the table.
2. A hung woollen blanket hides a small alcove. The alcove stinks. The stench is overpowering near a small crack in the floor. The guards use this area as a toilet.
3. A faded, frayed rug covers the floor directly in front of the door. It once displayed a crude pattern of blue and red swirls, but time and the goblins' attentions have destroyed its details. (You might rule the carpet covers a hollow in the ground; the goblins have used a mixture of loose soil and caltrops to create a nasty surprise for unsuspecting intruders).
4. A complicated mass of taut tripwires fills the passageway leading away from the guardroom. These tripwires are not attached to anything but are designed to slow down cautious intruders. (Perceptive characters notice some have come loose and just lie on the ground.)
5. A large pile of firewood is stacked haphazardly along one wall. Nearby, a fire pit smoulders; soot blackens the stone above, but a crack in the ceiling draws away most of the smoke.
6. As #5 but the pile is rigged to collapse and is held in place by several large wooden pegs rammed into the floor. If one of the pegs is removed the pile collapses— loudly—creating an area of difficult terrain. Characters adjacent to the front of the pile may be knocked over when it collapses.
7. Battered chests, earth-filled sacks and other rubbish forms a makeshift three-foot-high breastwork running across the chamber.
8. As #1 but the goblins were in the middle of a simple dice game when interrupted. Three sets of bone dice and a smattering of copper coins and other odds and ends lie scattered across the table.
9. Crude frescos of goblins butchering and dismembering their enemies decorate the chamber's walls.
10. The smell of sweat and something sweeter hangs heavily in the air. The goblins have got a small fire going and a pot of something bubbles over it. Investigations reveal they were boiling a pot of hallucinogenic mushrooms. 





## COMMON ROOM DRESSING 



1. This chamber is filthy. Rubbish overflows from niches in the wall. The place smells of sweat and rotting food.
2. This part of the chamber is divided off from the rest by a rickety fence held together with twine. Beyond lies a sleeping blanket big enough for three goblins, and other odds and ends.
3. A perceptive character spots one of the piles of bedding heaped against the wall moving slightly. Investigation reveals a terrified goblin child buried deep within. It offers no resistance while crying (loudly) for its mummy.
4. A blackened iron cauldron hangs over a crude fire pit. The surrounding floor is blackened and splattered with what could be dried stew and other unsavoury things. A large ladle hangs from a hook nearby. Stew of some unidentifiable sort bubbles gently in the cauldron.
5. Filthy, flea-infested woollen blankets hung from the ceiling provide a modicum of privacy in this part of the common room. Within lies the lair of a tribal champion.
6. A crude target stuffed with rags hangs from the wall. Scores of near misses pockmark the wall nearby.
7. A jumbled skull display fills a shelf high up on one wall. Several of the skulls have rolled off the shelf and lie on the floor. Many of them bear signs of stabbing and slashing wounds.
8. The stench from this corner of the room is unbearable. A crude wooden platform with a hole in it covers a small narrow pit hacked into the floor. This is the goblins' noisome latrine.
9. A jumbled mass of sacks, battered boxes and so on serves as the tribe's food storage area. Many of the bags and sacks contain mouldering or stale food. Perceptive characters searching the pile discover two flasks of decent red wine lost in its depths.
10. Four barrels lined up surprisingly neatly against one wall hold the tribe's home-brewed beer and hard spirits. The drinks are uniformly horrible and not for the weak of stomach. Any character having more than a sip is liable to wake up the next morning with terrible stomach cramps and a pounding headache. 

## CHIEFTAIN' S QUARTERS DRESSING 



1. This chieftain has a throne—well an ornate wooden chair —standing at the centre of a rickety wooden platform. The "throne" looks like the kind of chair you'd find at a noble's dining room table, but it has seen better days. A faded red cushion provides a modicum of comfort for the chief.
2. Dirty, frayed rugs cover the floor. Arrayed in a haphazard pattern, they comprehensively conceal what lies beneath. Paranoid characters might suspect pits lurk beneath. Indeed, the rugs directly in front of the chief's throne have several suspiciously large dried bloodstains.
3. A weapon rack—probably looted from some merchant's wagon—stands against one wall. Most of the weapons displayed are too small for the rack and have fallen through. They lean against the wall behind or lie under the rack.
4. Dozens of small niches pierce the chamber's walls. They contain red candle stubs and macabre bone decorations. Much wax has dripped down the walls giving the impression the haphazardly placed niches have been bleeding.
5. A curtain—comprising small bones threaded on thin metal wire—divides the chamber in two. Beyond lies the chieftain's bed-chamber. It is virtually impossible to pass beyond the curtain without making noise.
6. Crude paintings—little more than stickmen—decorate the walls in simplistic battle scenes. The red stickmen—who have large, pointy ears—seem to be beating the others.
7. A crude painting of an oversized goblin standing in a heroic stance wearing a shiny crown decorates one wall. Other goblins are shown bowing down before the crown-wearing goblin.
8. A large, battered chest, with its lid open, stands against one wall. Filled with a riot of different clothes, blankets and other odds and ends, it serves as the chief's personal wardrobe. Many of the items were obviously made for human-sized people and have been crudely altered. All are filthy.
9. A small pen comprising four empty, battered chests with their lids propped open fills one corner of the chamber. Therein, the chieftain keeps his pets—a family of five giant rats. The rats are feral, but recognise their master and do not attack him.
10. A battered stone statue of a human warrior stands against one wall. The statue is battered and chipped up to about chest height—as if someone had used it as a target. The warrior's nose has snapped off, but otherwise the statue's upper portions are in pristine condition. 





# HAUNTED HOUSE 



## HAUNTED HOUSE MINOR EVENTS 



1. From the area the characters just left, comes the distinct creak of floorboards—as if someone heavy is walking across the floor.
2. The temperature suddenly plummets to freezing around the party. Their breath mists the air and frost forms on the ground. Within a few minutes, the chill passes.
3. Somewhere up ahead a door rattles in its jamb. The rattling is loud and sustained. When the characters reach the door, the sound suddenly ceases.
4. The indistinct sound of whispering or muttering comes from a random direction. No matter how hard they listen, the party can make out only one word…death.
5. A faint glow of light—as given off by a candle—comes from behind a door or around a corner. When the party moves to investigate, the light is suddenly extinguished.
6. As #5 above but the light dances wildly as if caught in a strong wind. As the party moves to investigate, the light is extinguished and a strong wind momentarily batters the party.
7. With a crash, a small object such as a tankard on a nearby table smashes to the floor.
8. The sound of scrabbling comes from within the nearby wall. It sounds like dozens—if not scores—of some small animal such as a rat—are trapped within. The sound reaches a crescendo—loud enough to drown out normal conversation —before abruptly ceasing.
9. A deeper, indistinct shadow seems to move in the dark just beyond the party's lights.
10. One of the party suddenly feels dizzy —as if he had been spun round and round—and sick. If the character engages in strenuous activity within the next five minutes, they are violently sick.
11. A character suddenly feels a stinging pain on the back of their neck. Investigations reveal three deep slash marks—perhaps made by ghostly fingernails. The character takes minor damage, though it requires magic aid to heal.
12. With a low creaking sound, a door in sight of the party slowly opens. When they approach, the door slams shut in their faces!
13. One of the characters discovers a minor weapon— perhaps a dagger—is missing. If they retrace their steps to look for the weapon, they find it stabbed into the floor. The weapon's hilt is strangely cold to the touch.
14. The cloying scent of rotting food hangs in the air. If the party spends any time in the room searching, the smell gets stronger and stronger.
15. The characters at the back of the party hear the sound of quiet sobbing from the room they just exited.
16. One character suddenly has an overwhelmingly powerful hot flush. Sweat breaks out on his face and he must rest for a moment.
17. Wet footprints suddenly appear on the floor in front of the party.
18. Strange stains running down the walls from the ceiling make it seem like the house itself were bleeding. The stains are a dried rusty brown colour and give off a faint, indistinct odour.
19. The atmosphere in this part of the house seems stale and stagnant no matter what steps are taken to let in fresh air.
20. A loud voice—with no apparent source—suddenly shouts the name of one of the party. 





## HAUNTED HOUSE PHENOMENA 



1. Living creatures hunger and thirst twice as fast as usual within the haunted house.
2. Disturbing an object in the haunted house causes it to ooze sticky, green slime.
3. Mirrors reflect their subjects' images but these reflections are endowed with fiendish qualities.
4. Cobwebs as thick as curtains fill several rooms within the haunted house.
5. Dusty skeletons sit in every chair and upon every couch within the haunted house.
6. Dirty, white sheets cover every piece of furniture.
7. Dust that has settled within the haunted house is impossible to clean off, sticking to everything within the house and resettling moments after it is cleaned.
8. All food discovered within the house appears edible, but is actually rotten and sickens for one minute anyone who eats it.
9. Threats toward intruders are carved into the walls of 1d4 rooms within the haunted house.
10. The gaze of every portrait in the haunted house seems to follow the explorers' progress.
11. One room is filled with illusory people; the illusions dance in a ballroom, eat in a dining room etc.
12. Each time a character exits a room, the furniture and decorations rearrange themselves.
13. Thunderstorms and a strong wind (21 mph) constantly batter the haunted house.
14. A graveyard with freshly dug graves sits behind the haunted house. One empty grave for each intruder pierces the ground.
15. Choking vines cover the outside of the haunted house and seem to grow rapidly if cut down.
16. The haunted house includes a moat, river, or pond filled with spectral (or skeletal) fish.
17. Every tree within 100 feet of the haunted house is twisted into the shape of an agonised human.
18. Musical objects randomly play themselves for any living audience that can hear them perform.
19. Objects within the house harmlessly break or explode when a living creature passes nearby.
20. Heavy footsteps echo throughout the haunted house's rooms at random intervals. This never occurs in the room explorers occupy. 

## HAUNTED HOUSE RUMOURS 



1. The house has a deep cellar. Whenever anyone explores the cellar, the shadows cluster thickly about them and they always find an area of turned earth—as if something had recently been buried.
2. One of the family's children was locked in the attic for some—now forgotten but minor—transgression. The child was headstrong and tried to escape; he fell from the roof and was killed. His spirit still lingers in the attic, yet searching for a means of escape.
3. Several servants in the house reported the feeling of being watched whenever they went up to the second floor. Some doors refused to open for them, no matter how hard they tried to open them. Most of the servants left the family's employ shortly after taking up service but more than one disappeared never to be seen again.
4. A secret cellar under the house hides a deep well of ancient artifice in its shadowy recesses. Surrounded by a crumbling wall of curious design, the well plumbs some unknown water source. Those drinking from the well invariably fall ill and are never the same again.
5. Rats infest the house. Before it was abandoned tales told of a servant slain by a horde of the foul creatures when he was sent to retrieve a bottle from the wine cellar.
6. Faint lights of unwholesome hue are sometimes seen bobbing about the house after dark. These are the souls of all those bound to that accursed place.
7. One of the maids working in the house was an adherent of a demon! She lay with her master in the master's bed and when her child was born the clueless family allowed her to stay in their employ. Soon her child grew big, strong and malevolent. Thereafter, a series of tragic accidents claimed the lives of the family's children.
8. A malevolent sentience lurks within the house. Some say the very essence of the Abyss imbues the house with a terrible purpose—to carry away all those who linger within to an eternity of torment at the hands of a terrible demon lord!
9. More than one resident of the house has been driven stark raving mad by something lingering under that accursed roof. Two have jumped from the roof and one died under the wheels of his own carriage.
10. Ancient tunnels link the house with a rambling set of natural caverns that emerge far from town. Smugglers, kidnappers and worse used the tunnels until the house was abandoned. 





## HAUNTED HOUSE TREASURES 



1. A grand harp carved with images of cavorting satyrs stands near the wall. Its strings emit an ear-piercing scream when first plucked.
2. Two heavy silver candlesticks lie on the floor. One of them is stained with old blood.
3. A seven-headed serpent is carved into the walls of the room. Its scales are covered with gold leaf.
4. A crystal chandelier fell to the floor and shattered here. Many of the crystal pieces are large enough to salvage.
5. Hanging on the wall is an oil painting depicting a demonic doe devouring her young. The painting's frame is studded with flecks of ruby.
6. Hidden amidst a tangle of rotten flowers is a single crystal rose.
7. This beautiful wooden box is engraved with the image of a rampant unicorn. Inside, the box is filled with expensive cigars.
8. A painting of an old woman is hidden beneath a white sheet. Careful inspection reveals the lines and wrinkles on her face spell out fiendish runes.
9. A dinner table is neatly set with four places—each having a silver fork, knife and drinking cup. All four cups are filled with wriggling maggots.
10. Piles of holy symbols are heaped in this room. They are covered in teeth marks.
11. Discarded chisels and stone dust cover the floor. In the middle of the room stands a statue of one of the characters. The statue holds a diamond-studded key in its left hand.
12. A large golden serving platter perches atop a pile of refuse. Hundreds of flies cling to its polished surface.
13. An intricately engraved locket hangs from a peg on the wall. One half of the locket holds a painting of a child. The other half holds a painting of a hairy spider.
14. This oil painting depicts a horde of demons pushing humans into a fiery pit. It is signed by the famous painter Bendo Trornio.
15. An ornate set of carving knives rests near a tray of spoiled meat. The blades are freshly sharpened.
16. A wardrobe contains five beautiful ball gowns. Each is covered in thick layers of spider webs.
17. Every piece of this golden chess set shows the piece dying in a different, painful way.
18. Each of the coins behind the glass of this collector's display is engraved with the face of a different character.
19. At first glance, the subject of this painting is a clothed skeleton; close examination, however, reveals the fixture to be an incredibly emaciated old man.
20. The treasure is spectral and insubstantial. Roll again, to determine its details. 


## THINGS IN A RATS' NEST 



1. A mass of faeces intermingled with ripped pieces of cloth and shards of bone.
2. A seven-foot-long length of frayed hemp rope. One end is tied around a rusty piton.
3. A mouldy leather boot lying on its side. A rat's skeleton fills the boot.
4. These ripped and shredded wool trousers are missing one leg below the knee. A hidden pocket at the waist holds a single shiny platinum piece; only perceptive characters find the coin.
5. A great mass of sawdust and gnawed pieces of wood hide the remains of a now ruined, but once beautiful, carved wooden deer.
6. The bones of a small dog (or possibly a large fox) are scattered about the nest. All the bones show signs of extensive gnawing.
7. A half-eaten, now rotting rat corpse. A small arrow protrudes from the remains of its back.
8. Strips of red silk are intermingled with scraps of leather and wool. A strand of fine silver thread (worth 5 gp) runs through the silk. A hasty searcher misses the thread.
9. What was once a fine oaken wand lies amid the detritus of the nest. Chewed arcane sigils once held the power to conjure forth mystical fire but the rats' attentions have destroyed their power.
10. A bizarrely twisted and warped rat skeleton. Strangely— perhaps even worryingly—the rat seemed to have had six legs and two heads! 





## THINGS IN A SPIDER' S WEB 



1. A thick bundle of webs holds the dried and desiccated remains of a gigantic rat. The size of a dog, the rat's corpse bears several jagged puncture wounds.
2. Dust covers part of the web. When it is shaken —perhaps in battle or while being searched— the dust cascades to the floor temporarily obscuring vision and causing anyone in the area to cough as it fills their lungs.
3. A pile of bones—obviously from a human-sized humanoid—lie scattered below the spider's web. Investigation reveals the skull and spinal column are missing; characters searching the web find them suspended in a ripped cocoon.
4. Scores of tiny spiders scuttle about the web, busily spinning their own tiny webs. The tiny spiders are the spawn of the giant spider, but there are not enough of them to swarm. Individually, they are no threat to explorers although perceptive individuals note that some of them have a jagged red pattern on their bodies.
5. One part of the spider's web has been cut down. Wisps of webbing hang from the surviving portions of the web and several desiccated, partially eaten rat corpses lie scattered about the floor.
6. Water drips through the ceiling over o n e p o r t i o n o f t h e w e b . Consequently, that part of the web glistens in the party's lights—perhaps enticingly or suspiciously so.
7. Incongruously, a finely wrought dagger with a discoloured blade hangs in the webs just above the party's heads. Retrieving the weapon is easy but may alert whatever lives on the web to (tasty) intruders.
8. Thick webs fill the area. In one particular area, the webs are wrapped tightly around a yet moving humanoid form. The humanoid is completely enmeshed but still struggles to free itself. If the party frees the trapped individual, they discover an adventurer recently succumbed to ghoul fever...
9. Part of this web has a strange red hue to it. Investigations reveal a spray of dried arterial blood covers much of the webbing. Clearly, from the amount of blood splattered about the place, whatever lives in the web has recently dined well.
10. The skeletal remains of a half-dozen individuals lie scattered about the floor beneath this thick web. A casual examination reveals that all the skulls are missing. A search of the web reveals all the missing skulls. 





## ABANDONED HOUSE PERILS 



1. The floorboards are weak—riddled with woodworm and rot. When a character steps on a weak board its breaks, possibly dropping the explorer into a lower floor, forgotten void or the cellar.
2. Mould grows voraciously over a wall. Invisible spores fill the surrounding air. Characters breathing in the spores could develop a nasty disease.
3. A wooden door is swollen shut. Characters pulling it open may be surprised (and injured) when they wrench it from its hinges and it topples over…on top of them.
4. Dripping water has severely damaged the ceiling. As the party passes underneath, pieces of it collapse.
5. A ratty, mouldy rug covers the floor. Perceptive characters notice the middle of the rug moving slightly— as if it is breathing. Removing the rug reveals a hole in the floor from which issues an intermittent breeze.
6. The floorboards are weak—riddled with woodworm and rot. When a character steps on the board, they break and trap the unfortunate's foot in place.
7. Shards of pottery (or glass) and chunks of wall and ceiling litter the floor. The pottery shards lie hidden among the other debris and act as caltrops.
8. A wooden door is swollen shut and tremendously rotten. Characters trying to yank the door open with its handle instead pull it off in their hand—making it much harder to open the door with subsequent attempts.
9. A veritable field of tiny mushrooms and mould cover the floor—thriving in the damp, gloomy environment. Water drips down from above making the whole rather slippery (particularly for those moving rapidly).
10. A large pile of rotting furniture, joists from the ceiling and so on blocks access to a door or corridor. The pile is unstable; if taken apart without care and caution, it collapses onto those trying to clear it. 

## UNFORTUNATE DISCOVERIES 



1. A bloody message is scrawled across a mirror. It reads, “One of you has been taken.”
2. As the characters walk past a closed door, something on the other side knocks on it.
3. A horrific squealing fills the air and a large rat crawls into view. Although it has no discernible wounds, the rat contorts in agony for a few seconds and then dies.
4. A thick layer of dust that has been undisturbed for ages covers the entire room. Mysteriously, a smouldering cigar rests in an ashtray near the wall.
5. No one can remember the names of any deities while they are in this house.
6. Coffins are stacked from the floor to the ceiling. Loud thumping and groaning come from somewhere within the room.
7. After a lengthy discussion, the characters realise none of them is speaking in a language they recognise.
8. A flock of dead ravens forms the lines of a summoning circle on the floor. Judging by the smashed windows in this room, it appears the birds flew into this position on their own.
9. The sound of laughing children echoes through the house. Thick rivulets of rancid chocolate begin dripping through cracks in the walls and ceiling.
10. Footsteps echo behind the characters for a few seconds each time they stop moving.
11. When retracing their path through a dusty area, the characters notice an extra pair of misshapen footprints mixed in with their own.
12. Three people sleep in this room. Although slumbering, they are standing upright and swaying in unison.
13. No one who steps inside this house can stop smiling.
14. A severed head constantly whispers and looks around with wide eyes. If the characters listen to it, the head seems to be warning them about things they cannot see.
15. Hellish screams suddenly fill the air as the room spontaneously bursts into flames.
16. Floorboards creak and moan under the weight of a great beast no one can see. The stench of its hot breath is overpowering.
17. Two bloodshot eyes watch the characters through cracks and holes in the ceiling.
18. Thousands of crows live in this house. At random intervals, they grow quiet before restarting their cawing.
19. When a character falls asleep in this house, they wake with their arms crossed and a coin over each eyelid.
20. Characters leaving this house have paler skin as if they haven't been outside for months. 





## THINGS IN AN ABANDONED HOUSE 



1. Cobwebs—heavy with cocooned insects—fill the corners of this dank, gloomy chamber; a veil of cobwebs fills a doorway leading further into the building.
2. Rotting, mould-shrouded furniture stands against the walls of this chamber. A heavy, formal chair is particularly far-gone, and one leg collapses if the chair is disturbed.
3. The shattered remains of several pewter mugs lie scattered across the floor. A dented and bent pewter plate lies against one wall. Dust covers everything.
4. The sound of faint scrabbling comes from deeper in the building. If a character investigates, a squirrel clutching a nut darts out of the darkness.
5. A mouldering brown blanket lies where it fell.
6. A strange dark stain mars the floor of this chamber. Investigation reveals the stain is likely old, dried blood.
7. Someone has pried up the floorboards to reveal a small cobweb-filled space. A faint outline in the dust hints that a small box or coffer was once stored here.
8. Black mould has grown over one wall of this room, and the air is redolent with the stench of decay.
9. Part of the wooden wall has been pried loose and the boards tossed casually aside.
10. The roof is partially missing, and the rain has gotten inside. The floor is damp and features several puddles.
11. The hinges of this door have failed, and only the door jam holds it in place. If the door is opened, it collapses into the room with a loud thud.
12. The floorboards in this chamber are rotten. They collapse if subjected to a weight of 100 lbs. or more.
13. Someone has covered one wall in graffiti daubed in charcoal. To the untrained eye, the graffiti looks like nothing but deranged scribbling. Scholars of the occult may realise, however, that the scribbles look a little like the sigil of a certain elder, blasphemous power...
14. A sack stands in one corner. It contains blankets and old clothes sized for a child. All are now mouldy.
15. A pile of mouldering planks—pulled from the walls and floors—are stacked in the centre of the room.
16. The fireplace in this room has obviously been used relatively recently. The ash within is still faintly warm, and marks in the dust show where someone slept.
17. Thick dust coats the floor of this room. Nothing—except the tracks of small insects—is visible in the dust.
18. Small droppings—probably from rats or mice—cover the floor by one wall. Several small holes gnawed at the bottom of the wall show where the rodents live.
19. Mottled green slime coats the ceiling. The slime is harmless, but adventurers may suspect otherwise.
20. The door to the room is wedged shut. Either debris has fallen against the other side or it has swollen in place due to water damage. 





## THINGS IN A BURNED OUT HOUSE 



1. The building's blackened chimney rises from the surrounding piles of scorched and burnt wood. Debris chokes the fireplace.
2. Bizarrely one section of the soot-stained wall survived the fire undamaged. Someone has written graffiti—the names of the people who died here—in the soot.
3. Part of a bed's wooden headboard sticks out of a pile of burnt and scorched debris.
4. The fire that destroyed this building was powerful. The building's stone foundation stones are scorched, and several cracked in the intense heat. Similarly, the branches of a tree nearest to the building are blackened and burnt.
5. Pieces of partially melted iron lie amid the ruins. One is reminiscent of a cauldron or pot, while others nearby might have once been utensils of some sort.
6. Birds now nest amid the scorched rafters of this once fine home. The rafters rang over the ruin like blackened bones reaching into the sky. If disturbed, the birds fly up out of the building into the air; perhaps their sudden appearance could alert the characters to a lurking ghost (or vice versa).
7. Three crude gravemarkers of blackened wooden planks stick out of the muddy earth behind the house. Bunches of dying flowers lie upon each grave, suggesting at least one person cares about the people who once lived here.
8. Rubble and the scorched remains of two wooden beams partially cover a hole in the ground. Investigation reveals that the hole leads down to a root cellar. The wooden stairs leading downward were badly damaged in the fire and collapse if any meaningful weight is put on them.
9. Attempts have been made to salvage useable materials from this ruin. Near what was once the front door, someone has dumped a pile of wood that survived the fire in relatively good condition; another pile of scorched and burnt offcuts lies nearby.
10. The soot-wreathed bones of one of the building's unfortunate residents lie pinned beneath an unstable pile of debris. Trying to reach the skeleton is dangerous; the pile could shift or collapse if disturbed. 

## THINGS IN A PLAGUE HOUSE 



1. A bloody blanket lies twisted on the floor. The blood is dried and from the pattern of the stain looks like it was coughed up.
2. The remains of a meal—a plate holding mouldy bread and hard cheese—stand next to a fallen pewter cup.
3. The door to this room has been crudely nailed shut from the outside.
4. A terrible smell of rot pervades the house; clearly, someone died here. The stench gets stronger as the characters get closer to the remains.
5. Much of the furniture lies scattered about out of place. Either someone was enraged and took out his frustrations on the furniture, or someone has searched everywhere for loot.
6. Dust and grime cover most surfaces in the room. Faint footsteps lead toward a back room. A character skilled in tracking can tell the person making the tracks was shuffling in a most strange fashion.
7. The rotting corpses of three rats lie on the ground near the body of one of the house's occupants. The body lies with one arm stretched; many small bite marks on the arm are evident.
8. The building's windows are all boarded over…from the outside. Inside, gloom fills the house, and dust sifts down through the cracks of sunlight piercing the interior.
9. A body—wrapped in sackcloth—lies in state on a long table. Burnt-down candles surround the suppurating corpse and its bloody, grimy wrappings.
10. A man hangs from a makeshift noose thrown over a rafter. Clearly dead, his neck is broken, and insects swarm over his decomposing corpse. In a nearby room, the party finds his family's rotting bodies together, under a blanket. 





# HENCHFOLK & HIRELINGS 



## CLERICS & PRIESTS 



1. JANAELA SHAKIRAE A white surcoat emblazoned with a radiant sun covers this half-elf woman's newly polished chain armour. Janaela Shakirae (LG female half-elf cleric [Darlen] 1) serves her lord with joy and reverence. Although she loves her brethren and church, she has decided to walk the land to bring Darlen's message and aid to as many folk as possible. Personality: For Janaela, from grief came love and purpose. She has wholly accepted Darlen into her life and preaches his message whenever possible. Janaela is brave but cautious. In dangerous situations, she balances the help she can offer now against the help she could give over her long life. Mannerisms: Janaela litters her speech with stories and praise of Darlen. Her favourite oath is, “By the Justiciar's Blazing Orb!” She uses it at virtually any opportunity. Background: Janaela was orphaned when she was ten. Given into the care of the clergy at Tor Abbey, she has served Darlen for her entire adult life. Hook: Janaela only joins an adventuring party sharing her general ethos. She takes it upon herself to act as the group's moral compass—even if she is not in charge.
2. KAARLO MARKKU With hair cropped so close he is practically bald, bulging muscles and a hard gaze, this man has the look of a dangerous predator. Kaarlo Markku (N male human fighter 1/cleric [Kalron] 1) exults in the joy of battle and dreams of becoming a legendary hero. His most prized possession is one of his father's old battleaxes. He is never without the weapon and takes excessive risks to retrieve the axe if he loses it. Personality: Dedicated and focused on all matters martial, Kaarlo is somewhat one-dimensional—and boring. He is an unimaginative man given over wholly to perfecting his skills and worshipping his patron. Mannerisms: Kaarlo is brash and egotistical. In conversation, he emphasises how great he is. This can come across as desperate for approval—particularly from warriors more skilled than himself. Background: Kaarlo's father was a mercenary and often absent. When he was home, he drummed his philosophy into his impressionable son. Now Kaarlo seeks his father's approval the only way he knows how. Hook: Kaarlo practises his skills and exercises incessantly —even when on an adventure he performs his nightly routines around the campfire. The sounds of his exertions could attract predators and marauders.
3. TUOMO KETO A look of firm conviction is fixed on this handsome man's face. Tuomo Keto (LN male human cleric [Conn] 1) recoils from the lawlessness and suffering he has witnessed on the borderlands and in the slums. Law and order are all, and he must impose them on those who know no better. Personality: Tuomo is devout and inflexible. Mannerisms: Tuomo picks his nose when he thinks no one is watching. Background: Tuomo follows the family tradition of worshipping Conn. His mother is the curate of a distant temple; everything Tuomo does he does to impress her (and serve his lord). Hook: Tuomo believes the local lord and his servants are corrupt and preaches such in the local marketplace. The lord's servants and soldiers share a different view.
4. WILLITHAR VONOTHVAR Wearing a battered shirt of chain and a belt bulging with pouches, this woman has a wry smile on her face. She carries a morningstar and several daggers. Willithar Vonothvar (NE female half-elf cleric [Braal] 1) conceals her true allegiance and morals. She can masquerade as a fighter or even a thief. Personality: Conniving, self-centred and obsessed with power and influence, Willithar is a dangerous woman. She is capable of almost anything, in pursuit of her goals. Mannerisms: Willithar is easily irritated—especially by weakness and indecisiveness—and is not shy in showing it. Background: Young Willithar had everything her wealthy parents could give her. When the family fortune faltered she stole everything she could and abandoned her kin. Hook: Willithar only uses her spells when alone or in dire straits. When questioned about her spell use, she spins a tale of an ancient curse on her family that forces them to call on the power of darkness and shadow. She is very convincing. 




## FIGHTERS & WARRIORS 



1. ANTHIC OVLAG Pale of skin and black of hair, this stout dwarven warrior has scarred forearms and calloused hands. He wears a suit of heavy dwarven chain and carries a heavy warhammer. Anthic Ovlag (LN male dwarf fighter 2) diligently serves his patron but does not needlessly lay down his life. Personality: Brave, trustworthy and loyal, Anthic is the quintessential dwarven warrior—except he is terrified of spiders. He loves ale and is entranced by stars. When the night sky is clear, he sits for hours gazing upwards in wonder. Mannerisms: Gruff and to the point, Anthic loudly clears his voice before speaking. He lets others finish speaking before replying and expects the same courtesy. Background: Anthic's clan is in a long, slow decline, and he has turned to an adventurer's life to help them. Hook: Anthic dreams of returning to his kin with a great store of wealth. His clan needs new defences and mercenaries to guard them. This embarrasses him, and he does not willingly speak of it.
2. EINAR LEINO Slender but whip-fast, this young man moves with grace and poise. He wears form-fitting studded leather and has two short swords at his belt. Einar Leino (N male human fighter 1) personifies grace and fluid motion, in battle. In truth, Einar would much rather be a dancer or entertainer. He is not an enthusiastic warrior, and only adventures to earn gold. Personality: Einar takes no unnecessary risks and is terrified of a debilitating physical injury. He would rather die than be unable to dance. He seems like a cheerful fellow, but a perceptive character realises he doesn't enjoy the adventuring life. Mannerisms: Einar subconsciously tries out subtle new foot movements and patterns for several new dances he is working on. Background: Einar's parents run a tavern—the Spinning Maid—in Languard, and he grew up amid the busy nightlife of a tavern dedicated to dancing. His parents are in trouble— deeply in debt to various unsavoury types—and Einar adventures to pay off their debts. Hook: Einar loves dancing and carousing. When the party reaches a town or city he disappears into its nightlife. He may not emerge from his debauch for days—maybe leading the characters to suspect something is amiss.
3. FIRATRIS SHAKIRAE This tall and slender half-elven woman wears dirty, but serviceable, leather armour. Her boots are mud-stained, but her bearing is proud and erect. Firatris Shakirae (CG female half-elf ranger 2) hates towns and cities, feeling suffocated and constrained within such environs. She only works with other good-aligned folk and is deeps uncomfortable on long underground expeditions. Personality: Firatris feels a deep, spiritual connection to nature. She is most at home in rolling hills or untouched woodland. She hates goblins and their ilk and takes every opportunity to hunt such foul creatures. She is also musical, and at night passes the time playing on her handcrafted wooden flute. Mannerisms: Firatris speaks slowly in a lilting, singsong voice. She rarely—if ever—raises her voice in anger. Background: Dwelling with her elven mother, Firatris's early years were peaceful and serene. When goblins fell upon her home and slew most of her neighbours, Firatris fled into the deep woods with other survivors. There she dwelled for a decade before emerging to wreak her vengeance on all goblin-kin. Hook: During an adventure, Firatris discovers a set of goblin tracks leading away from the party's goal. She insists on tracking down the goblins.
4. TERTTU VUOLLE Dark of skin and with closely-cropped dirty blond hair, this woman has an oft-broken nose. She wears a white tabard emblazoned with a rising sun. Terttu Vuolle (LG female human paladin [Darlen] 1) quests to help the common folk and serve as their shield against the encroaching darkness. Terttu only serves like-minded folk. Personality: Many people would have been broken and warped by Terttu's early life experiences. For Terttu, they forged an unbreakable will and desire to do good. She always does the right thing—irrespective of the consequences. She dreams of founding an orphanage. Mannerisms: Terttu touches her holy symbol, when talking about something important to her. Background: Terttu comes from the streets, and was mercilessly bullied and exploited during her early years. She had to do things on the streets to survive, which she only confides in a trusted confidant. Her experiences are the engine that drives her to help those in need or danger. Hook: Arriving in town after an adventure, the party are searching for an inn when Terttu witnesses a street thug beating up a child. Investigation reveals the child was a thief beaten for not stealing enough, and the thug is a low-ranking member of a local thieves' guild. Terttu demands the party take action. If they don't, she will. 





## THIEVES & ROGUES 



1. BAREDAL RAULNOR This slender gnome wears worn and supple studded leather armour and carries a virtual arsenal of daggers about his person. He has a merry, welcoming smile. Baredal Raulnor (CN male gnome thief 3) acts quickly and decisively without putting much thought into planning for the consequences of his actions. He is brave—almost suicidally so—and relentlessly seeks the next sliver of intoxicating excitement. Personality: Adventure's call resonates with Baredal, and he is never happier than when engaged on some (preferably dangerous) quest. He is a free spirit who lives in the moment; he rarely considers the consequences of his actions. Mannerisms: Baredal speaks in clipped, excited tones and gesticulates expansively (and wildly). Background: Both of Baredal's parents were wildly overprotective and rarely let the young gnome out of their sight. When they died—protecting him and his brother from raiding kobolds—he vowed to see the world and to experience all he had missed. Hook: Baredal always suggests—when he bothers to suggest anything—the most dangerous course of action. This could land his employers or companions in no end of peril.
2. ELENA REKUNEN Hard lines mark this skinny woman's weather-worn lean face. She wears her muddy blond hair cut short and has grey-green eyes—which never seem to rest on one thing for long. Elena Rekunen (NE female human thief 2) trusts no one and should, in turn, be trusted by no one. Elena is out for Elena. She is a consummate actor well versed in hiding her true self. Personality: Elena loves only herself—and the comforts and respect wealth can bring. She grew up in squalor and has sworn she will never again endure such deprivation. Mannerisms: Elena is overly tactile with those she speaks —particularly those she is conning. Background: Elena grew up in the worst part of Languard's Shambles district. Her life was hard, and everyone was out for themselves. Hook: Elena's plan is simple. Earn the party's trust and then exploit the party's trust. She is not an idiot, though, and has no intention of fighting the entire group.
3. HELMI MARKKU With shoulder-length brown hair, green eyes and an acrobat's build, this woman has grace and poise. Helmi Markku (NG female human thief 1) flees a false accusation of murder and theft. Her real name is Laina Purho, but she never uses it in case it brings attention to her. Personality: Helmi finds it difficult to trust people—she expects to be betrayed—and is guarded and defensive as a result. She loves the bustle and hubbub of towns, and isn't a big fan of extended wilderness trips. She dreams of earning enough money to be able to start a new life in a distant land. Mannerisms: Helmi has supreme balance and poise. In idle conversation, she often takes various poses designed to stretch her muscles and improve her balance. Background: Helmi was an acrobat in a travelling troupe of entertainers and bards. The company performed for a powerful baron; during the performance, the baron's treasury was ransacked and several guards and the baron's daughter were slain. Helmi was identified (falsely) as the culprit and has been on the run ever since. Hook: Bounty hunters and assassins still hunt Helmi—the reward for her capture is exceeding generous. As the characters are resting in a town or city after a recent adventure, Helmi overhears rumours of folk asking about her. She immediately prepares to flee, but one of the characters interrupt her.
4. THORIC VALZAK Black of hair and eye, this dwarf has long, slender fingers and a look of intense concentration on his face. Thoric Valzak (N male dwarf thief 2) loves tinkering with any kind of device. This mechanical genius has several theories about locks, cogs and wheels that he can't wait to try out on a huge scale. In the meantime, he adventures to gain as much experience (and gold) as possible. Personality: Mechanical devices of all kinds fascinate Thoric. From an early age, he delighted in taking things apart to understand them. His obsession with his work has left his social skills sadly undeveloped—even for a dwarf. Mannerisms: When working on a problem or device, Thoric has a look of intense concentration on his face. When he is not engaged in such a task, he often daydreams about one of the many devices he plans to construct. Background: Thoric's parents were skilled but unimaginative crafts folk. He found living within their strictures insufferably boring and adventures to catch up on all the excitement he missed as a child. Hook: Thoric encounters a fascinating lock or other mechanical device. This discovery comes at an inopportune time, such as when the party are being chased. However, Thoric insists the party help him recover the device so he can study it further at his leisure. He sulks if this is not possible. 





## WIZARDS & SORCERERS 



1. ANNELI LOPONEN Wearing light revealing robes, this woman wears a many pouched belt at her waist and carries a gnarled walking staff. She has black hair, pale skin and piercing blue eyes. Anneli Loponen (N female human wizard [necromancer] 1) embraces all aspects of death—except her actual death. Her clothes feature many skull and bone motifs, and her most prized possession is a bleached cat's skull. The cat was her beloved childhood pet, and she believes its spirit lingers in the skull. Personality: Death and the undead fascinate Annelli. She feels a strong kinship with the dead she cannot explain, but seeks to understand. Mannerisms: Anneli likes the cold—it makes her feel as if death's embrace is excitingly near—so she does not often seek out warmth. She wears light clothing, except in the worst weather. Background: Anneli's mother was homeless and gave birth to her daughter amid the tumbled stones of an old burial cairn. The latent echo of death lurking in the tomb infused her newborn soul. Hook: Anneli's obsession with the undead can be disconcerting. Instead of destroying them on sight, she tries to interact with any new kind she encounters.
2. JANI OUTILA Devastatingly handsome, this tall, muscular man wears sumptuous blue and silver wizard's robes. His curly brown hair tumbles to his shoulders, and his grey-brown eyes sparkle with intelligence and empathy. Jani Outila (NG male human wizard 1) loves himself—and why wouldn't he? Stunningly handsome, tremendously clever and well educated Jani is the epitome of a civilised man. Personality: Jani is a kind and decent man but is handicapped by his narcissistic tendencies. Jani loves history, art and poetry. Annoyingly for his detractors, he is skilled in all three disciplines. Mannerisms: To relieve stress, Jani rolls his shoulders and massages his neck. Background: The son of a noble, Jani has received virtually every advantage a person could enjoy. He has health, intelligence, education and good looks, and he's decided to put them all to good use. Hook: Jani wants to prove himself to his father. In his mind, he can do this by becoming a great wizard or by excelling in one of his other interests. When the characters reach a town or city, Jani discovers a festival of the arts in the offing and can't resist the opportunity. He has a dalliance with the wife of a local merchant who—inevitably—catches them in the act. The merchant is locally influential and decides Jani and his companions must pay for his indiscretion.
3. KAUNANNA NATITYRR Impossibly slender and graceful, this elven woman wears shimmering white and gold robes. Her violet eyes sparkle with intellect. Kaunanna Natityrr (CG female elf wizard 1) personifies impatience. Cursed with an elven master who preferred slow and steady progress, Kaunanna has come to human lands to gain the power she so craves. Personality: Impetuous, impatient and easily bored, Kaunanna can be a handful to deal with. For all that, though, she is genuinely good and craves power and knowledge for the good it will do her people. She passionately believes the strong should protect the weak. She despises bullies. Mannerisms: Kaunanna speaks quickly and forcefully. Sometimes she speaks so quickly, her words blend into one long sound. Background: Born into a near-timeless and peaceful elven society, Kaunanna has been bored or restless for as long as she can remember. Hook: Kaunanna has joined the party because she believes she can learn something from them—particularly any wizards, sorcerers or other worshippers of the god of magic in their ranks. At a critical juncture of an adventure, she meets someone else who can teach her something new, and her loyalty to her fellows is sorely tested as a result.
4. VILJO KORPELA This slightly overweight, middle-aged man has a friendly smile on his plump face. He wears his long brown hair tied up in a ponytail. Viljo Korpela (NG middle-aged male human wizard 2) hides his confusion at life and polite society behind the visage of a kindly sage. The intricacies of personal relationships baffle Viljo, and he is writing a (dry, academic) book on the subject. Personality: Blessed with a keen analytical mind and boundless curiosity, Viljo is lonely and desperate for companionship. He loves music but lacks the physical dexterity to play any instrument well. Mannerisms: Viljo incessantly makes notes in a small journal he carries everywhere. Sometimes he is so focused on writing he is oblivious to everything around him. Background: Viljo comes from a good family. His parents are still alive but in their twilight years. They are good folk and desperately want their son to be happy. Hook: News reaches Viljo that his mother has fallen ill, and he rushes to her side. A chest infection has struck her down; can one of the characters help? 











# HILL GIANT STEADING 



## THINGS NEAR A STEADING 



1. A vaguely triangular pile of rocks looms over the trail, casting a long, deep shadow across the ground. The huge skull of some kind of fantastical beast—perhaps a wyvern—leers down from atop the pile.
2. Deep, booted footprints mar the ground, in a confused jumble. Most lead in the direction of the steading.
3. A tall, slender column of stones stands atop a slight rise overlooking the surrounding terrain. A small pile of skulls is heaped atop it.
4. A half-dozen burial cairns of tumbled, moss-covered stones dot the hillside. All are large; it is likely a giant is interred within each. Ragged, weatherworn banners flutter in the breeze over several of the cairns.
5. A thick tree trunk has been driven deep into the ground. The mouldering corpse of a muscular, black-haired humanoid hangs crucified from the trunk. Investigation reveals the crucified individual was an orc; he has been here for at least a month.
6. The smashed, broken and rotting remains of a mountain goat lie partially crushed beneath a large boulder. Scavengers have worried the bits of the corpse not crushed beneath the boulder.
7. A hill giant has snuck away from his fellows to enjoy three flasks of wine. Drunk, he staggers over a nearby rise singing lustily. Unless the characters are particularly obvious, he doesn't notice them and goes on his way.
8. A heap of throwing boulders is stacked on a low ridge overlooking the trail. Investigation reveals many giant footprints and a few discarded wine flasks, animal bones and the like. This is clearly a sentry post, but no giant is currently in attendance.
9. Bones, rubbish and detritus fill a narrow, deep chasm piercing the very bedrock of the hills. The narrow chasm is entirely natural; the hill giants are using it as a rubbish dump. The smell wafting from its depths betrays its presence from some distance away—particularly if the characters are downwind.
10. Claw marks mar the stone here. Nearby lurk several large piles of excrement. A character steeped in wilderness lore can identify the piles as wolf excrement. 

## STEADING EVENTS 



1. The sound of deep voices and laughter, coming from some unexplored part of the steading, fills the air. It seems a celebration is in progress.
2. The party encounter an orc slave carrying several large bloody wolf pelts. The orc is distracted and does not notice the characters unless they are making a tremendous amount of noise. If given the chance, he drops the pelts and flees shouting.
3. A deep rumbling snore emanates from around the corner. Investigations reveal a hill giant slumped against the wall asleep clutching an empty wine flask in one massive hand. He is almost impossible to wake.
4. The heavy smell of burning meat and smoke wafts through the steading.
5. Cold water drips down from the poorly constructed ceiling, onto a character's head.
6. Several smoky, burning torches provide flickering light here. As the characters enter the area, one of the torches gutters out; long shadows fill one corner.
7. The howling of wolves, quickly followed by deep, guttural shouts break the relative silence. The wolves howl, and the giants shout, for a minute before the hubbub subsides.
8. An orc slave, Rel, staggers into the party. Recently beaten by his master, he is disorientated and taken completely by surprise. Rel hates his master and burns for revenge. If the characters treat him kindly and offer to help him escape Rel tells them much about the steading (although he does not know about any hidden chambers and the like).
9. A loud banging, followed by the sounds of fighting reaches the characters' ears. Shouts and roars continue for a short while before subsiding. (Several giants were playing a crude gambling game and one was caught cheating). Later, the characters may discover the site of the impromptu game. (See #13 in “Steading Dressing”).
10. A sudden blast of cold wind buffets the steading. The wind whines through the many cracks in the steading's walls creating an eerie whistling sound. 





## STEADING DRESSING 



1. The ceiling is poorly constructed; water drips down from above to form a puddle on the floor.
2. A large brown bearskin is nailed to the wall. Its open jaws are easily ten-foot above the ground (and make a good place for a giant to hide some small trinket).
3. A discarded, frayed giant's bag lies in one corner. It holds a wheel of hard, mouldy cheese and a mangy (worthless) wolf pelt.
4. A haphazardly stacked pile of firewood stands against one wall. The large logs are the thickness of a human's torso and could be used as missiles by nearby giants. Rats infest the pile.
5. A faded and filthy tapestry covers one wall. Clearly not of giant artifice it depicts a range of majestic, jagged hills rising into the distance. The tapestry is roughly ten-foot square and now worthless.
6. Three torches—nothing more than hacked tree branches wrapped with cloth—burn here. The atmosphere is foul and overly warm; smoke coils about the ceiling.
7. Trophies—mainly comprising skulls and rotting heads of humans, dwarves and bears—hang from pegs driven deep into the walls. Perceptive characters notice one of the rotting heads still wears a small silver stud earring (worth 5 gp).
8. Splotches along with a thick smear of dried blood decorate the ground. The splotches lead toward the giants' kitchen.
9. A large crudely-crafted bench sized for giants stands against one wall. Its surface is pockmarked with many gouge marks likely made by bored giants.
10. Here, the wood of one wall is dripping wet and rotten. Water runs down the wall from above and the smell of rot hangs heavily in the air.
11. A gigantic spear—perhaps 20- foot long—leans in a corner. Examination reveals the haft is particularly thick and the spear's point comprises a short sword whose handle has been wedged into a notch cut into the top of the spear's haft.
12. Wolf, bear and other hides of more exotic nature as well as a half-dozen blue wyvern scales decorate the walls. One of the larger hides obscures a small (currently unoccupied) cubby hole or guard post.
13. A set of knucklebones, three dice and four empty flagons lie abandoned on the floor. Nearby a large (empty) wineskin hangs from a poorly dressed branch protruding from the wall. It seems the gamblers have now departed—perhaps in search of more booze!
14. The smell of wet wolf fur and excrement fills this area. An impressively large pile of relatively fresh wolf droppings decorate the floor near one wall.
15. Shadows and cobwebs heavy with dust cluster thickly about the rafters high above the characters' heads. The walls of undressed logs make accessing this area relatively easy. Characters exploring the rafters discover a carefully concealed route through the cobwebs which leads to a small niche cut into the wall. Two empty wine flasks lie in the niche.
16. Pegs driven into the walls hold a variety of bags, cloaks and other soiled pieces of giant-sized clothing. Several cloaks hang all the way to the floor and could make excellent impromptu hiding places. Most of the bags are empty, but one holds a 100-foot-long coil of very strong, thick hemp rope.
17. A rough map of the surrounding area hangs on one wall. The crude map is etched into the back of a gigantic mouldering bearskin. The map shows the steading, several nearby human settlements and a cave mouth over which the words, “Cavern of Whispered Death” is crudely written.
18. The smell of cooking meat wafts through the air.
19. An orc slave slumps unconscious in a shadowy corner. Beaten near to death by its hill giant master for some transgression, the orc will die unless healed. If healed, the orc—Bargesh—is wary, but if offered his freedom happily tells the characters anything they want to know about the hated giants. Bargesh isn't suicidal, however, and has no interest in fighting giants.
20. A large brass gong hangs from its stand in the centre of this area. The gong is battered and dented—it has clearly seen much use. A warhammer sized for a human or dwarf lies on the floor under the gong. 





## ABNORMAL HILL GIANTS 




### APPEARANCE 



1. Balding with a single, bushy eyebrow, this giant's face is fixed in a perpetual snarl.
2. A simplistic tattoo—perhaps of an eagle—decorates the giant's forehead. The tattoo is so bad, though, in truth it is hard to determine precisely what it depicts.
3. The smell of sweat and other noxious stenches precedes this giant by a good ten feet.
4. This giant wears a crudely made wolfskin cloak that isn't really long enough. If the party includes any wolf or dog companions, the giant goes for the animal in preference to other targets.
5. Although bald, this giant has a full beard and thick sideburns.
6. This giant's clothes smell of smoke, and other foul things.
7. Missing an eye, this giant wears a furry eyepatch. She has an impressive head of elaborately braided hair.
8. As a berserk, this giant prefers to battle in the nude, to better terrify his enemies. He spends the first round of combat screaming insults at his enemies…and stripping.
9. Massively fat, and swathed in layers of animal fur, this giant waddles into combat.
10. Something of a tribal champion, this giant wears the bleached skull of a large draconic creature (a wyvern) as a helmet. 

### BATTLE TACTICS 



1. Particularly stupid—even for a giant—this giant gets so excited he throws his club at an enemy, disarming himself. If he can't retrieve his club, he wrestles the weakest-looking enemy.
2. This giant shouts and screams terrible, but colourful, threats before charging into battle to intimidate his foes.
3. A bully, this giant goes for the smallest available target.
4. This giant is scared of dwarves and avoids fighting them if at all possible.
5. A keen “slinger” this giant prefers to hang back from battle and throw stuff—anything—at his enemies. He targets spellcasters and archers.
6. This shortsighted giant gets exceptionally close to her enemies before rolling stones at her target as if she was playing marbles.
7. Terrified by fire, this giant flees battle if an enemy uses magical fire.
8. This giant has just captured a live goat he plans to eat later. With his hands full, and without any stones, he uses it as a missile weapon.
9. This giant has a comically high-pitched voice and uses it —badly—to inspire his comrades in battle.
10. Violent even for a giant, this warrior loves to grab and bite his enemies. He savages any unconscious or helpless opponent. 

### TRINKETS & TREASURES 



1. A mangled sheep's corpse fills this giant's bag.
2. This giant wears a wyvern's skull as a helmet (see #10 in Appearance). He has wedged a pair of large onyx into its eye sockets. Each is worth 150 gp.
3. This giant's cloak is cut from the fur of a single gigantic mountain lion. Its head comprises the cloak's hood. Such an impressive example—if cleaned—is worth 50 gp.
4. A haunch of burnt meat fills this giant's sack along with some small (for the giant) shiny stones he thought were pretty. They are nothing but smoothed river stones.
5. A necklace of fangs—from wolves, bears and so on— hangs around the giant's neck on a leather thong. Many of the teeth are worn and yellowed with age.
6. The giant keeps a bent longsword in its bag to use as a knife. The blade is ruined, but tentacle etchings on its pommel are picked out with silver wire. The pommel is worth 50 gp.
7. Something of a thinker among her fellows, this giant keeps a bloodstained, faded and weather-worn book in her bag. It seems to be an ancient treatise on the surrounding hills and depicts several (now ruined) fortresses unknown to the characters.
8. This giant uses a backpack sized for a human as a pouch. It contains 50 ft. of rope, a flask of brandy (which the giant hasn't found) and a thick winter blanket.
9. This giant is unlucky. His bag has a hole in it, and his treasures have been falling out for weeks. All that remains are 3 gp caught in a fold, a small boulder and a battered and empty bone scroll case.
10. This giant's (oversized) bag is actually a mimic that had recently attached itself to the giant… 





## THINGS IN A HILL GIANT' S BAG 



1. A freshly killed sheep, its wool coat covered in drying blood fills the bag. The sheep's skull has been shattered.
2. The giant has been busy carving a new club. Slightly more artistic than his fellows he is carving the head of the club to resemble a gigantic fist. Along with the club, the bag contains wood shavings, offcuts, a battered battle-axe and a dulled handaxe.
3. Three throwing stones along with a small wrought iron coffer fill the sack. The coffer is locked and dented. It contains 27 sp, 135 gp along with a broken potion vial. The inside of the coffer smells slightly of cinnamon.
4. Several branches ripped from a bush or tree—destined to be kindling for the giant's next fire. One of the largest could be used as a club, in a pinch.
5. The giant has been hunting wolves. Its bag contains four bloody wolf pelts and a rusty longsword that once belonged to a human warrior. The giant uses it to skin his kills.
6. The bag contains a half-empty, battered barrel of thin, vinegary red wine. The cask leaks slightly and the bottom of the sack is damp. In extremis, the giant uses the barrel as a missile weapon.
7. The giant recently discovered some shards of rock studded with glittering ore. Entranced, he collected the shards and they are now his treasured possessions. Sadly, the glittering ore is fool's gold and worth nothing.
8. This giant delights in harvesting the heads of those he has slain. He keeps his trophies in a bloodstained bag that reeks of dried blood and decomposing flesh.
9. A tremendously varied mix of ripped and torn clothes fills this bag. The clothes are of a variety of styles and sizes. A smaller sack also contains a roasted haunch of some unidentifiable meat.
10. The remains of a large canvas tent and a long length of rope fill this bag. A crude hole has been cut in the tent. (The giant uses the stained tent as a poncho of sorts).
11. A large battered brass bowl—actually a small cauldron— and a bent ladle which the giant uses as a spoon half-fill the bag. The cauldron was once fine; the remains of carvings and etching run along the cauldron's rim, but what they once represented is impossible to determine.
12. A dozen crudely forged caltrops; several of them comprise daggers and knives wrapped together with string—they are less than effective fill the bag.
13. A dirty iron cooking pot; the grime and leavings of countless meals coats the pot's inside. A half-dozen bones of indeterminate origin and some unidentifiable sludge—perhaps old stew—fill the bottom of the pot.
14. Four small boulders; two are riven with deep cracks. When thrown they burst apart on impact and shower anyone in the immediate vicinity with stone shards. The restaurant rubble creates a small area of difficult terrain. (The giant has no idea of these boulders' special quality).
15. A drinking horn smelling vaguely of stale, vinegary wine and a half-wheel of old, mouldy cheese. Perceptive characters notice several worn gold coins wedged into the cheese. (This is the giant's “genius” hiding place for his treasured loot).
16. A small bag of salt, a bundle of nondescript bones wrapped in an old, threadbare human-sized cloak and freshly skinned brown bear's pelt. The bear pelt is missing the bear's head.
17. A 40-foot-long coil of thick rope crafted from three normal ropes braided together. The whole is bulky and heavy, but incredibly strong along with a drinking horn and a blunt battleaxe of dwarf-craft.
18. A hunch of charred meat—perhaps a bear or mountain lion wrapped in a bloodstain cloth along with a half empty wine flask. The red wine is surprisingly good. and full-bodied.
19. One blood-smeared boulder along with a drinking horn, a smaller bag full of animal teeth and a broken comb fill the bag.
20. A full waterskin, a soiled winter blanket once dyed blue but now ingrained with mud and dirt and a haunch of meat fill the bag. 





## HILL GIANT PETS 




### APPEARANCE 



1. This huge wolf's fur is mottled grey and black. Bizarrely, white fur covers its muzzle.
2. This wolf has survived a horrific injury; it has only one ear, and its left eye is nothing but an ugly mass of swollen scar tissue.
3. A wrought iron spiked collar hangs around this wolf's neck; dried blood coats the spikes.
4. Covered in shaggy fur, this wolf looks even bulkier than its brethren.
5. Clumps of this wolf's fur have fallen out, giving the creature a forlorn, diseased appearance…until it bares its teeth.
6. Clad in a patchwork of studded leather armour, at first glance this wolf looks a little like a warhorse!
7. This wolf wears a thick collar of woven rope. The rope is blood- and dirt-stained.
8. A crude bandage is wrapped around one of the wolf's legs. The dirty bandage is yellowed with puss, and the filthy wound smells infected.
9. With red-rimmed eyes and a snout drawn back in a snarl, this hoary old wolf appears almost demonic.
10. This wolf's glossy fur is so black it seems to drink in the surrounding light. 

### BATTLE TACTICS 



1. Before darting into battle, the wolf throws its head back and spends an entire round howling.
2. Fixated on the smallest visible foe, this wolf slinks toward its target. If the wolf downs its target, it carries away the body for a feast.
3. Fire terrifies this wolf. It avoids anyone carrying or wielding flame and immediately flees if it suffers fire damage.
4. A scavenger, this wolf darts behind opponents to take down a vulnerable target.
5. Starving hungry, this wolf charges into battle with only one thing on its mind: food.
6. At heart a bully and coward, if reduced to half hit points this wolf flees battle yelping with its tail between its legs.
7. This wolf darts in and out of combat and tries to draw its target away from the safety of its allies.
8. Once the companion of a hill giant priest, this wolf makes straight for the first enemy to cast a spell.
9. This wolf hangs back from battle until one of its enemies is on the ground (either because it is unconscious, dead or has been tripped by another wolf). It then charges in to savage the downed foe.
10. A bully and opportunist, this wolf chases down any enemy fleeing battle; until a foe flees it stays on the periphery of the battle. 





# ITEMS MOST WONDROUS 



## WONDROUS ATTIRE 



1. Of supple leather, these knee-high boots are incredibly soft. They fit their owner's feet perfectly and slowly change colour to match the wearer's outfit. Perceptive characters notice the owner leaves much shallower tracks than normal, when wearing the boots.
2. With built-up heels, these sturdy leather war boots are thick and tough. Marred by all sorts of old stains including mud, blood and other unidentifiable things these boots appear worthless, and certainly not something a well-to-do adventurer or noble knight would willingly wear.
3. This almost blindly white fur cloak is completely without blemish of any sort. No stain sticks to the cloak for longer than a few minutes. Although of fur, the garment is lightweight and no more encumbering than a lightweight summer cloak.
4. This slender golden belt shimmers in the light as its owner moves. Supple and strong it has the flexibility of rope and the hardness of iron.
5. With a deep cowl, and silver and gold threads depicting a bewildering array of esoteric symbols, this jet black cloak clearly once belonged to a wizard or person of similar ilk. A faint, unplaceable scent hangs in the air about the garment. The smell does not dissipate no matter how often it is washed.
6. Several large dents mar these thick iron gauntlets. Two black stones (onyxes) and two transparent yellow stones (citrines) fill slightly recessed settings on each gauntlet. Although the gauntlets are dented, the stones are in perfect condition.
7. This scarlet robe has long billowing sleeves. Beautifully stitched yellow and orange flames writhe up the sleeves towards the shoulders. Similar flames decorate the hem. Several discreet pockets inside the robe are perfectly sized for a small coin or spell component pouch.
8. Set with two small hidden pouches on its back this broad, well-used and slightly fraying belt is decorated with beautiful etchings of soaring dragons. The belt's golden buckle is forged into the likeness of a smiling dragon's face.
9. This heavy, flowing, but hoodless, cloak comprises a bizarre mix of brown fur and mottled tawny brown and white feathers—the cloak is crafted from an owlbear's tough hide.
10. These low, soft leather boots are worn with much use and are incredibly comfortable. Oakleaf sigils woven from thin bronze wire decorate both boots' ankles.
11. Little more than silk slippers these red shoes are immaculately clean and resist all blemishes and stains. The slippers are affixed to the wearer's feet via long, slender silk ribbons.
12. Wildly impractical this exquisite cloak comprises two interwoven layers of delicately wrought lace. One layer of lace is black while the other is white. Gold and silver braiding decorates the cloak's hem. The vestment provides no protection from the elements whatsoever.
13. At first glance, this worn black leather belt appears to be nothing special. However, a close investigation reveals tiny black and red beads stitched into the belt. The beads form certain magical sigils associated with the belt's powers.
14. Etched with delicate runes picked out with platinum thread woven into their length these elongated bracers cover the wearer's entire forearms. The bracers are supple, fit exceptionally well and are secured to the wearer's arms with crimson silk straps.
15. This mottled black leather cloak has a deep cowl. The cloak is a heavy thing and seems to press itself about its wearer's body. Until the wearer gets used to this sensation it can feel unpleasant—almost claustrophobic. The cloak has two large hidden breast pockets.
16. These skin-tight gloves of fine calfskin fit exceptionally well. Ornate blue and white stitched lightning bolts decorate the back of the gloves.
17. Scorched and battered these thick leather gloves have a woollen lining that keeps the wearer's hands marvellously warm but reduces their manual dexterity.
18. A simply wrought sigil of a rising sun decorates both faces of this heavy, circular silver amulet. The sun—and its rays—are picked out in a gold wash. The amulet glimmers invitingly in the light and is warm to the touch.
19. Wrought in the shape of an oval shield this silver brooch has a thick iron clasp on the back. Several small dents mar the brooch's surface and a close examination of the piece reveals what could be tiny impact marks.
20. This soft brown leather hat perfectly fits the head of anyone donning it. A wide band, from which sprout three gold and white feathers, encircles the hat. 





## WONDROUS RINGS 



1. Crafted from a slender piece of magically shaped white ash, this ring appears sized for a human's little finger. The ring is incredibly smooth and free of any imperfection.
2. This solid, grey-iron ring is chunky enough to be used as an impromptu knuckleduster. Dwarven runes, whose meanings hint at the ring's powers, decorate the inside of the band.
3. A faint shimmer seems to hover over the surface of this golden band. The ring reacts in a particularly strange way to flickering torchlight and the like; the flame's reflections seem to dance and writhe across the ring's surface as if they are bound within.
4. Forged of platinum this plain silvery ring at first glance seems to be nothing particularly special. The ring is incredibly light and appears worn through much use. Perceptive characters, detect the almost worn smooth sigil of the legendary elven archmage Firmah Aralivar etched into its band.
5. The jagged shards of several teeth are fused into this cracked and seemingly brittle bone ring. The teeth jut from the ring, and easily snag on clothes and the like.
6. The surface of this plain iron ring is always slick with moisture, although it never slips from its owner's finger. Close observation of the ring reveals tiny beads of moisture appearing spontaneously upon the band. Experimentation reveals the liquid is seawater.
7. Grains of multi-coloured sand fill this supernaturally toughened glass ring. Every morning at dawn, the grains of sand rearrange themselves into a different pattern.
8. Beautiful carvings of shooting stars, or perhaps ball lightning or fireballs, decorate this exquisite ivory ring.
9. Five small settings each holding a tiny black stone (an onyx) stand proud from this tarnished silver ring. One of the piece's stones is slightly chipped (which may affect the ring's powers). The ring is an antique from a distant— now fallen—culture.
10. This chunky golden ring comprises a beautiful translucent purple stone (an amethyst) encircled by a rearing silver snake.
11. A single large gem setting dominates this ornate silver ring. Worn and tarnished, the ring is obviously old but the gem shines with a lustre undimmed by age. Disconcertingly, the ring's gem resembles an unblinking eye with a deep blue iris.
12. This golden ring has a boxy, angular design. A procession of tiny magical runes cover the ring's head. The work is exquisite and the individual runes are too small to see without a magnifying glass or magical aid.
13. Of white gold, this beautiful ring has four prongs designed to resemble curved flower stems. The ring's setting holds a beautifully bright transparent red stone (a jasper). Faint motes of yellow light dance within the stone and brighten considerably when the ring's power is called forth.
14. Crafted from bronze this old plain ring has strange runes of obvious magical origin inscribed all over its band. The ring is old and tarnished with age.
15. This chunky golden ring has an intricately wrought band that comprises three coiled, interwoven tentacles. The three tentacles come to together to hold a faintly glowing red gem (a ruby) in a recessed setting.
16. A pentagram surrounding the faintly glowing sigil of a lidless, staring eye dominates this silver ring's wide, flat head. Characters steeped in the arcana arts can identify the pentagram as one designed to imprison powerful extra-planar beings.
17. Crafted in the form of a snake-like golden dragon consuming its own tail this ring is both extravagant and beautiful. Tiny flecks of glimmering ruby comprise the dragon's eyes. A close examination of the ring yields the suggestion that the eyes are moving—and taking in all that occurs in the surrounds.
18. This ring has a particularly wide band, which covers half the wearer's finger. Delicately carved flecks of red, purple and golden stones (garnets, amethysts and ambers) cover the ring in a colourful mosaic of simple geometric shapes.
19. Thick dwarven runes cover the band of this chunky, dented golden ring. Except for the runes, that speak of the earth and the fearsome power lurking therein, the ring lacks any form of ornamentation or marks of identification.
20. This ring is not hewn or forged from any known kind of metal or stone. Instead, it comprises a living band of heatless, writhing flames that dance over and caress the wearer's finger that radiates the same amount of light as a candle. 





## WONDROUS RODS, STAVES & WANDS 



1. A red crystal tops this slender, fire-blackened shard of willow. Barely perceptible heat shimmers rise from the wood, and anyone firmly grasping the wand feels the heat pulsing within.
2. The grinning skull of an obscenely sized and proportioned rodent—its jaws gaping wide—tops this gnarled, twisted length of diseased wood.
3. Glimmering with a multitude of red, blue and green precious stones, this smooth, but thick, piece of iron has an obvious grip at one end. The object is surprisingly lightweight.
4. Fine gold and silver wire entwine about this length of beautifully stained oak. At one end, the wires come together in a tightly wound ball giving the whole a bulbous look.
5. Carved from a single long rib bone of indeterminate origin, complex etchings of screaming skull faces, ghostly forms and other horrific images of death and suffering decorate this macabre object.
6. This intricately carved length of slightly curved ivory must have come from a truly gargantuan creature. Complicated sinuous patterns, that doubtless took a master craftsmen months to complete, cover its entire length. Molten gold covers one end of the wand.
7. Set with thin coils of electrum, this slender, tapered length of stone looks for all the world like the tip of a stalactite. The thin electrum coils have been fused to the stone, and cannot be removed without destroying the object. The stone is always cool to the touch.
8. Slightly rusty, this length of iron bar has a jagged point at its tip while its other end is perfectly smooth. Engravings of strange and terrible beasts of unknown sorts decorate the bar but are partially obscured by tightly wound bronze and copper wire spiralling around the bar.
9. A chunk of pale blue transparent crystal surmounts this white wooden wand. Perceptive characters notice faint motes of yellow light drifting about inside the crystal.
10. Vividly-hued alternating bands of blue and red paint decorate this thick golden rod. Three translucent deep green gems (emeralds) stud the wand's tip, in a triangular pattern that points away from the wielder.
11. Comprised of living, writhing shadow this staff constantly “bleeds” wisps of shadow that quickly melt away. Only those who can call forth the staff's powers can actually hold it; everyone else's hands simply pass straight through its shaft without any impediment.
12. This golden staff has an ornate circular head in which is fixed a brilliant, bright blue chunk of glass the size of a child's head. The crystal glows with a faint yellow light. When the staff's powers are used this light strengthens to a deep gold colour.
13. Seemingly impossibly thin, this staff comprises hundreds of tightly interwoven gold and silver wires. Incredibly light, this brightly polished staff weighs virtually nothing and makes a high-pitched keening sound when vigorously swung.
14. This black iron wand has three tines in a similar fashion to a trident. A different colour gem (a yellow citrine, a black onyx and an orange carnelian) perch at the end of each tine.
15. Crafted from a chunk of faintly glowing blue crystal this wand pulsates when held. The wielder can adjust the light given off by the wand from that emitted by a guttering candle up to that given off by a brightly blazing torch.
16. This unremarkable wooden staff is the same length and width as a spear shaft. The wood is worn and has been repeatedly varnished. Near the shaft's midpoint, several small chips mar its surface as if someone had struck the staff with a sword or other bladed weapon.
17. Set with a silver cap at one end, at first glance this stout length of smooth and polished wood is nothing more than a finely crafted walking stick. Close investigation reveals tiny runes etched into the rod's silver cap.
18. This three-headed iron staff is a perversion of nature. The wand's three heads—dragon, goat and lion—writhe and twist when the wand is activated. While they do not try to bite the wielder, they lash out at anyone else coming too close. Each of the heads has a different power.
19. One end of this wand comprises a smoothed bone handle while the other—which tapers to a fine point— comprises a one-foot length of black wood.
20. Forged from black iron this heavy wand has been wrought in the shape of a thick wickedly pointed arrow whose tip has broken off. The “arrow's” fletchings have grooves cut into them to make the wand easier to hold. Investigation reveals the arrow to be hollow; a cunningly concealed catch opens a long thin compartment the perfect size to accept a normal-sized wand. 





## WONDROUS SWORDS 



1. With a gleaming steel blade and a handle wrapped in worn, supple leather this sword is well looked after. Careful examination of the weapon reveals its maker's mark—a pair of crossed swords—etched into the pommel.
2. The handle of this perfectly balanced sword comprises smoothed and polished ivory topped by a gleaming silver pommel. The blade is of watered steel and its wavy pattern seems to writhe and twist like a living thing in bright light.
3. A large circular black stone flecked with tiny white imperfections surmounts this blade's pommel. The stone is an onyx and has been magically hardened. If the sword has any additional powers, they emanate from the onyx; when they do so, the stone's white flecks glimmer and sparkle. The blade is called Glimmer Star.
4. Of ancient design, this sword's blade comprises magically hardened brass. Its plain hilt is much worn and the blade is thinner than normal; a close examination reveals a few tiny imperfections on its edge. The sword's bronze pommel is shaped like an oversized acorn.
5. At first glance, this sword appears to be coated in dried blood. Further investigation reveals it is forged from a single piece of supernaturally tough, crimson-coloured glass. In flickering light—such as that given off by a torch or funeral pyre—the blade glimmers in an evil fashion. A skull-shaped pommel tops the weapon's haft.
6. This razor-sharp steel sword has a snake's head-shaped pommel. Supple red and black snakeskin covers its haft. At its tip, several tiny holes pierce the blade. A thorough examination of the weapon reveals a small reservoir for poison in the sword's pommel.
7. Crude pictographs painstakingly etched into this sword's blade tell the story of a warrior entering a deep cave to slay a mighty, scaled creature that might be a multiheaded dragon or a hydra. Beyond the pictographs, and some deep gouges on its plain cross guard, the weapon is plain and simple—the kind carried by common soldiers. The weapon comes with a plain scabbard.
8. A dozen tiny precious stones of varying types and hues are set into this sword's hilt. A convoluted, serpentine pattern adorns the blade itself. The weapon's scabbard is likewise adorned with many tiny gemstones.
9. Of greenish copper strengthened with steel this sword's blade is a thing of malign beauty. Minutely etched scales reminiscent of a dragon's cover the entire blade. The weapon's haft is of some kind of incredibly light, but tough bone and its pommel is fashioned into the shape of a large, lidless eye.
10. Crafted from a long, yellowed bone of unguessable origin, this sword has a wickedly serrated blade. Its hilt of iron is shaped like a flattened, elongated skull—the sword's blade emerging from the skull's gaping jaw. The weapon's pommel is similarly of bone and is wrapped tightly in a length of blackened leather embroidered with a bewildering variety of tiny silver sigils dealing with death, suffering and torment.
11. When drawn from its scabbard this sword throws off sparks of bright, iridescent light. A beautiful shimmering wave-like pattern adorns the weapon's steel blade, which ends in a cross guard set with several small translucent red stones.
12. This plain and unadorned sword has a simple bone handle. Leather strips and beautiful many-coloured feathers festoon the sword's plain wooden scabbard. 

### SCABBARDS 



1. This red-hued scabbard comprises tiny scales from a red dragon. It glimmers evilly in the light and is immune to the effects of fire and heat.
2. Comprising a delicate, mesh-like chain over a thin inner layer of black leather this scabbard is surprisingly quiet.
3. Mystic symbols of esoteric and fell meanings cover this tanned hide scabbard. Delicately drawn onto the scabbard with blue, yellow and red inks the symbols give some clue as to the sword's origins and powers.
4. Artfully constructed from thin strips of beautifully lacquered wood, this scabbard is of elven construct. 






## WONDROUS WEAPONS 



1. Four-foot-long with a stout wooden haft wrapped in worn leather and a large iron-shod hammer head this warhammer is surprisingly light for its size.
2. Although its handle is worn with age and use, this battleaxe's blade remains razor-sharp. The weapon is old, and careful examination of its head reveals the tiny signs of painstaking maintenance with a whetstone.
3. This mace's heavy iron head resembles a clenched fist.
4. Scorched and discoloured, this heavy hammer may have once been a blacksmith's tool. However, scores of notches carefully etched into its handle now hint at a more martial use. The subtle smell of burnt flesh hangs in the air around the hammer's head.
5. Ramrod straight, this spear's shaft is perfectly balanced. The weapon has a long, tapered head that ends in a wickedly sharp point. Complicated geometric patterns decorate the entire weapon.
6. This slim, wickedly pointed stiletto nestles in a supple scabbard of soft leather topped by a ring of bright white fur. The weapon has a triangular pommel and deep grooves cut into the blade to channel blood away from the wielder's hand.
7. Ten barbed arrows nestle in this slightly oversized quiver. Resembling small harpoons the arrows cause terrible injuries when pulled forth from a target's body. Each arrow's fletching comprises two black feathers and one white feather.
8. This beautifully polished bolt case holds five heavy steel crossbow bolts sized for a heavy crossbow. Twice as heavy as a normal bolt, these missiles have ornamental sigils depicting bolts of fire, jagged lightning bolts and the like carved into their shafts.
9. This mace has a head forged to depict a snarling wolf's head. The weapon's shaft is of some highly polished and worn black wood. When it strikes a target, the mace snarls and howls like a wolf on the hunt.
10. Carved from a single piece of perfectly straight firehardened wood this spear seems at first glance to be nothing more than a primitive weapon. A collection of feathers tied just below the spear's point add to this look but its tip is as strong and sharp as the finest steel weapon. (The spear comprises the heartwood of a dryad's tree).
11. This battleaxe's head is heavy and thick. The axe's haft of polished wood is fully four-foot long. A few minor scrapes and dents mar the axe's head but otherwise it is in excellent condition. When swung it emits a faint keening sound.
12. Cracks radiate through this heavy warhammer's fireblackened head. With a shaft of iron, this is a heavy weapon. Scenes of heroic battle depicting dwarves slaying giants decorate the hammer's shaft.
13. Wickedly sharp this ornate and gracefully wrought throwing axe has holes bored through its handle to lighten its weight; the weapon is no less sturdy, however, as the wood came from an ancient elven forest and is imbued with the timeless magic of the elves.
14. Of elven artifice, this slender bow has been stained a deep and beautiful brown hue. Carefully carved etchings of an idyllic woodland landscape decorate the bow's shaft. Intermingled with the woodland scene are a variety of tiny elven magical sigils. The bow seemingly has no string, but when its wielder firmly grasps it a slender, gossamer-like bowstring instantly appears ready for use.
15. This halberd comprises a stout, well-worn five-foot long wooden shaft and a heavy axe-like head. The halberd's blade is painted black, although flecks of some kind of dark grey metal are visible under the head's black paint.
16. A knight's weapon, this beautifully wrought and perfectly balanced lance is deceptively light, but incredibly strong. At will, the wielder can alter the lance's length from 10 ft. to 5 ft. (and back again).
17. Although its haft comprises a length of gnarled and twisted driftwood and its tines are nothing more than the long fangs of some kind of unknown beast from the deep ocean this trident is perfectly balanced.
18. Long and slender—designed for slipping in-between the joints in a suit of armour—this dagger is a simple, brutal weapon. Its only decoration are tiny of forks of lightning etched into its blade.
19. A short spearhead juts from the bottom of this crescentbladed battleaxe's deeply stained, fire-blackened haft.
20. This black iron mace's head is forged in the shape of a grinning skull complete with short horns protruding from its ridged forehead. 





## QUIRKS FOR A WONDROUS WEAPON 



1. When whirled vigorously above the wielder's head for one round, the weapon emits a high-pitched keening sound not dissimilar to a scream.
2. When used to slay a sentient creature, the weapon emits a red glow equal to that of a candle for one hour per hit dice possessed by the slain enemy. If multiple enemies are slain, this time stacks.
3. The weapon is quasi-sentient and has a semblance of feelings. Occasionally, in situations of high stress, these feelings "leak" from the weapon and spill over everyone within 10 ft. Only a detailed magical examination of the weapon reveals the source of these feelings.
4. The weapon once belonged to a feared assassin or slaver. Their evil—and the metaphorical and actual darkness in which they lurked—has imbued the weapon with an unsettling ability. When cloaked in shadowy (or darker) illumination, wisps of darkness appear on its blade or haft. These wisps begin to swim to the weapon's head, tip or point. If the weapon remains in shadow long enough, the weapon goes completely black. This effect fades over the next few days.
5. The weapon is soundless in battle; when used to parry blows or strike enemies, it makes no sound.
6. The weapon creates a great clamour in battle; sounds created when blows are parried or enemies struck are amplified two-fold. It is almost impossible to use the weapon stealthily.
7. Blood sticks to this weapon and is hard to clean off. If blood is left on the weapon for longer than an hour or so, it starts to be absorbed into the weapon itself.
8. This weapon weighs only half what a normal weapon of its type should weigh. It is no less durable, as a result.
9. By grasping the weapon and concentrating, the wielder can change some facets of its appearance including its colour, general condition and apparent ornamentation. Such a change remains until the owner wills a change.
10. When the weapon was forged, magic was used to infuse it with diamond dust. Consequently, it glimmers in the light and appears far more valuable than a normal weapon of its type. Extracting the diamond dust without powerful magic is— sadly—impossible.
11. Quasi-sentient this weapon occasionally throbs and pulses in its wielder's hands. Determine the weapon's alignment randomly. If the possessor commits an action against its alignment the weapon writhes and twists in its owner's grasp—as if trying to escape.
12. Enchanted to battle and slay a certain kind of creature, the weapon can act as an early warning system to the presence of such enemies. When demons, devils, dragons or some other thematically appropriate creature is within 200 ft., the weapon quietly buzzes. 





## MINOR WONDROUS ITEM BOONS 



1. The item never gets dirty; mud, blood and dirt slide off it almost immediately. It is always in immaculate condition and resists minor tears, dents and the like.
2. The item can create a tiny flame for one minute a day. This illumination is less than that of a candle, but it can be used to light fires, ignite dropped oil and so on.
3. The item subtly throbs when bad weather is imminent. The intensity of the throbbing matches the intensity of the weather. So, for example, just before a light drizzle starts the throbbing may be imperceptible. Conversely, before a storm strikes the item loudly vibrates.
4. By holding (or wearing) the item, the owner can cause it to change colour. The colour remains, until the owner wills a change.
5. Infused with elven magic, the item increases the owner's ability to see in the dark. In shadowy light or darkness, the owner can see an additional 5 ft. without penalty.
6. At sunrise and sunset, the item pings gently for one minute. (This may be useful for clerics who must pray for spells at dawn if they cannot see the sun).
7. The item has minor powers of divination. If the owner sleeps on a particularly worrisome problem, while wearing or holding the item, they are targeted by an augury spell of the same caster level as the item's main power. In the morning, the owner awakes with the answer foremost in their mind.
8. The item exudes an aura of calm within 10 ft. that affects all domesticated animals. Pets, in particular, are drawn to the owner, and vigorously—and eventually annoyingly— demand attention. If the item's owner is particularly attuned to an animal—perhaps a beloved pet or animal companion—they can sense the animal's base emotions.
9. The item has a secret extra-dimensional space within it big enough to hold a potion vial or similar item. The owner can access the compartment by simply touching a certain part of the item.
10. The item smells strongly of roses. The owner can increase or decrease the intensity of the smell at will— which might give some protection from noxious odours such as the stench created by troglodytes and so on.
11. In subtle and barely noticeable ways, possession of this item makes the owner slightly more attractive to those of the opposite sex. Treat the owner's Charisma score as higher by one, in regards to such folk.
12. Imbued with slight telepathic powers, the item occasionally detects the thoughts and emotions of those around it, and shares such with its owner. 


## MINOR WONDROUS ITEM DRAWBACKS 



1. The item occasionally—and seemingly randomly— radiates light equal to that of a candle. The owner cannot control when this light appears or disappears.
2. This item's crafter was a glutton. During the crafting process he transferred some of his cravings to the item. Thus, the owner almost always feels hungry. His appetite would put a starving halfling to shame.
3. Shadows cluster thickly about the item, creating an aura of gloom and a faint feeling of foreboding for the owner, whenever its main power is used.
4. The wondrous item is twice as heavy as a normal mundane item of the appropriate type. Due to flaws in its construction, however, it is not twice as durable.
5. When in use, the item often glows with a randomly determined bright light. Roll 1d8: 1—red, 2—orange, 3— yellow, 4—green, 5—blue, 6— indigo, 7—violet, 8—no colour. This makes hiding or using the item surreptitiously difficult at best.
6. The owner's finger- and toenails grow at a prodigious rate; necessitating their trimming on almost a daily basis.
7. When the item is held or worn, bright light dazzles the owner and makes her eyes water in a similar way to how drow suffer in bright sunlight.
8. At some point in the past, the item was exposed to a smell anathema to dogs. Dogs and wolves will not willingly approach the owner. Indeed, they bark and bare their teeth if the item's owner approaches them.
9. Whenever the item's owner uses its power, he hears a faint whispering coming from some indefinable source. The whispering is too quiet to make out any actual words and no one else can hear it.
10. Owning the item proves disastrous for the possessor's hair. Over the first few weeks of ownership, the owner's hair turns progressively greyer. After a month, it begins to fall out. Getting rid of the item reverses this process over a similar amount of time.
11. The item's enchanter, a drow or member of another underground-dwelling race, suffered terribly from agoraphobia. Some of their fear was transferred into the item—its owner now feels uneasy in large outside spaces.
12. Bizarrely, the item massively reduces its owner's resistance to alcohol. No matter how “good” a drinker they were, now a single glass of wine of flagon of ale is enough to render them impressively drunk. 





## WONDROUS DAGGERS 



1. The dagger's pommel is remarkably smooth and highly polished. The blade itself is wickedly sharp—sharp enough to be used for shaving.
2. This long-bladed, serrated dagger has a similarly long haft—it could be wielded two-handed if desired or could even serve as a halfling's short sword.
3. Strange patterns and shapes—perhaps reminiscent of flames or serpents—seem to writhe in this dagger's blade when exposed to direct, flickering light (such as that given off by a torch or campfire).
4. This dagger is clearly ancient. Its blade is slender and shows signs of much sharpening over its long existence. The haft is also worn, although its leather grip has obviously been replaced recently.
5. This dagger's tip has snapped off and all that remains is a wickedly jagged stump. The dagger's hilt and haft are wrapped in blood-stained worn leather.
6. A long, serrated and slightly curved blade gives this dagger a fell, exotic look. A black stone—that seems to suck in the light—decorates the weapon's pommel and makes the whole slightly heavier than normal.
7. This dagger comes complete with a sheath made of tremendously rigid hide flayed from some unknown beast. The dagger itself is heavy and wide-bladed. Grooves in the blade channel blood away from the haft.
8. Originally commissioned for an assassin, the steel of this dagger was mixed with ash when forged; thus it is duller and less reflective than a normal blade. A cunning catch in the pommel opens a small compartment just the right size for a vial of poison.
9. A leather loop runs through a small hole bored through this dagger's pommel. Designed to be slipped over a hand, the loop makes it harder to disarm the wielder.
10. Stamped with esoteric runes all along the blade, this highly polished and razor-sharp dagger looks particularly lethal. The runes speak of death and otherworldly pain. Chips of translucent blue stones decorate the weapon's hilt, although several of the chips are missing.
11. This glimmering silver slender dagger of elven artifice is tremendously well balanced. It glimmers and gleams in the light. It comes with a matching snow-white scabbard.
12. Forged from a shard of heat-blasted, carefully carved obsidian this dagger has a primal, elemental look to it. Parts of the weapon are stained with long-dried blood which the obsidian seems to have partially absorbed. 



## WONDROUS KEYS 



1. This tiny key is made of worn brass. It hangs upon a similarly worn neck chain. Several faint runes decorate the key's bow but they are now (sadly) unreadable.
2. This two-inch-long iron key slips into a hidden compartment in the pommel of an otherwise innocuous dagger. The dagger's pommel must be unscrewed to extract the key.
3. This key's barrel is pitted and scarred as if it had been splattered with acid. It is, thus, exceedingly delicate; if used roughly, it likely snaps off in the lock.
4. Large and ornate, this black iron key is almost a foot long and weighs 4 lbs. It could serve as a weapon, in extremis.
5. This large iron key holds a clever secret—a smaller key hidden in its stem. This smaller key is accessed by unscrewing the larger key's bow. The larger key does not fit any lock in the dungeon.
6. The bit of this barrel's key is worn as if by much use. The lock it fits is similarly degraded.
7. The bow of this iron six-inch-long key is forged to look like a skull complete with eyes sockets and teeth. The stem of the key looks disturbingly like a spinal column...
8. Of brass, this key is still shiny and new; it has practically no signs of use upon its teeth, but someone has scratched "TC 1" into its bow.
9. This key is so large—almost two-foot-long—surely it is only ceremonial in nature; the lock required to fit this monstrous key would be huge. It weighs nearly 10 lbs., and could be used as a bludgeoning weapon.
10. Crafted of multi-faceted, magically hardened glass, this key reflects light in strange many-hued patterns. Crafted to bypass a magical ward of fiendish resilience and complexity it opens the warded area by casting its shadow on the door in a certain location.
11. Forged from thin, tarnished silver this key is a fragile object. If it is treated roughly, dropped or the like it will bend or break and not fit its lock.
12. Alternating bands of coloured paint akin to the colours of a rainbow decorate this key's stem. The paint is newly done and of vivid hues, but done in an amateurish fashion. The order of the colours on the key is an aidememoire for the bypass method for a trap hidden elsewhere in the dungeon. 





## WONDROUS LONGSWORDS 



1. Plain, unadorned and of solid, functional design this longsword holds a wickedly sharp edge. A maker's mark —a hammer set under a soaring raven—adorns the hilt.
2. Polished to a mirror-like sheen, this is a noble's weapon. Its hilt is of smoothed ivory and the cross guard is wrapped with silver and gold wire.
3. The blade of this chipped and battered longsword is old and dangerously weak. The pommel and hilt are of much newer and solid design; they are clearly not original.
4. Several esoteric sigils denoting victory and glory decorate this longsword's hilt. The weapon's haft is well worn, implying it has seen much action; however the blade itself is in excellent condition.
5. This longsword has an ornate basket hilt, which is chipped and dented. The blade itself is highly polished and glimmers in the light.
6. The pommel of this serviceable weapon is shaped like a clenched, gauntleted fist.
7. The hilt of this longsword is of horn wrapped with worn leather for better grip. It has a simple cross guard inscribed with the sword's name, “Gutripper”.
8. The pommel and cross guard of this crude, heavy longsword are stamped with Goblin runes. They speak of glory, death and battle. It is sized for a hobgoblin.
9. This sword's pommel is carved from a large shard of onyx to represent a grinning skull. Additionally, ash has been worked into the blade and haft to give it a dull, dark grey appearance that seems to drink in the surrounding light.
10. This silvered steel longsword glitters and glimmers in the light like ice. Runes speaking of goodness, light and glory are engraved into the blade while the holy sigil of a good-aligned martial deity decorates the pommel.
11. Forged in the blazing heat of a dying ancient red dragon's heart blood this sword glows with subtle crimson light. The blade is super-hard and resistant to all damage inflicted by a lesser weapon.
12. Glimmering gems of blue, green and red decorate this sword's cross guard and pommel. The gems are worth a substantial amount of gold, but if they are removed, the weapon loses its magical powers. 



## WONDROUS MACES 



1. Set upon a haft of stout oak, this mace's oval-shaped head is worn smooth on one wide.
2. The iron pear-shaped head of this mace glistens as if it were wet. A leather loop threaded through the weapon's haft makes it harder to drop.
3. Small holes are bored through the mace's spherical head. When the mace is swung vigorously, the holes create a high-pitched whistling sound.
4. This mace has a haft of iron and a small square pommel.
5. The haft of this mace is of dull iron worn smooth through countless hours of use. Similarly, the head is dented and chipped suggesting it has seen much combat.
6. The head of this mace was forged to depict a snarling demon's head. Dried blood covers the demon's face and one of the demon's horns has snapped off.
7. Lurid scenes of battle and death are engraved on this mace's haft. Some of the ornate carvings have been damaged—probably in battle.
8. A grinning iron skull sits atop this mace's haft. The skull has been painted white to appear more “real” but the paint is faded and chipped. Thus, the skull has a mottled —almost diseased—look.
9. When caught in bright light this mace's circular head gleams and glimmers like the sun.
10. Mystical symbols—worn smooth by use and age—adorn the head and haft of this ornate flanged mace. The mace has four flanges—on each, the mystical symbol for one of the elements appears prominently.
11. A magically hardened demon skull serves as the head of this blasphemously-shaped mace. The weapon's haft is of the fire-hardened horn or some kind of foul denizen of the Abyss. This is the kind of weapon wielded by one of evil's great champions.
12. The name of the weapon's first wielder—Vilimzair Aralivar —is beautifully (perhaps even reverently) etched into its haft in flowing elven runes. Other names—less well engraved—also decorate the hilt. 







## WONDROUS RINGS 



1. This band of burnished silver has patches of obvious wear and a few nicks and scrapes mar its surface.
2. Intricate etchings of wind-blown leaves cover this golden band. Worn runes—possibly of elvish origin— decorate the ring's inner surface, but they are illegible.
3. This gold band has three small glimmering stones set within; two glow with a faint reddish light while the third gives off a pale white luminosity.
4. This golden band has been forged in the shape of a serpent eating its own tail. The snake is so finely detailed its eyes and fangs are visible as are the tiny scales covering its body.
5. A small rent in this iron ring almost split the band in twain. The repair—while not crude—is clearly visible.
6. A single setting holding an overly large crystal dominates this otherwise plain, but exquisitely forged ring. The large crystal glows with faint red, blue and yellow hues.
7. This thick, smooth platinum ring would be heavy but for the score or so holes punched through its band. These holes—of varying sizes—are of common geometric shapes. There seems to be no obvious pattern to the holes' placement.
8. This ring seems to be carved from a lump of whiteflecked granite. The outer edge is jagged and uneven while the inner is worn smooth through wear. The ring always feels cool to the touch.
9. This silvery ring is in perfect condition. Its highly polished band glimmers in the light and astute characters may realise it is crafted from mithral. Tiny esoteric symbols etched into the inner band speak of the union of magic and the natural world.
10. This signet ring is emblazoned with the image of a shooting star hurtling downwards. The ring itself is of beaten gold, and the shooting star etching is picked out with silver.
11. This cleverly wrought overly large golden ring has a clever secret hidden within. Seemingly randomly etched into the ring a series of lines are actually contour lines. When light hits the ring at the right angle, the ring's shadow throws a crude map onto a nearby surface.
12. Forged for a giant, this thick golden ring or elder artifice can be worn as an armband or torc. While worn thusly, the ring still grants its powers to the wearer. 

## WONDROUS SCROLL CASES 



1. Of bleached bone, this long scroll case was once the leg bone of some tall creature. Stoppered at one end with a bone plug a leather cap fits over the other.
2. Of stretched and hardened leather, this scroll case is surprisingly rigid. Investigation reveals the leather is stretched over a framework of thin, strong, copper wire.
3. Decorated with various sigils of esoteric power, this leather scroll case is soft and malleable. The sigils look freshly painted and a faint, undefinable smell hangs over the case.
4. This seemingly unremarkable leather scroll case comprises a cleverly constructed wooden framework. It conceals a hidden compartment at one end big enough for a few gems or coins (or perhaps even a potion vial).
5. Somewhat oddly, this wooden scroll case opens by pulling the two ends apart, rather than unscrewing one end. The wood is highly polished and stained a deep brown, but is dented at one end—as if dropped.
6. Tiny panes of multi-coloured stained glass decorate the exterior of this oversized scroll case. Within, the case holds several distinct sections making the storage and sorting of several scrolls easy. The case's glass decorations glimmer enticingly in direct light.
7. Painted white, this scroll case bears a single sigil—a cloud from which lightning bolts rain downwards—upon its surface. (This sigil is the device of the case's first owner).
8. This cast iron scroll tube is four times as heavy as a normal scroll case. Etched with pictures of intertwined dragons, it is an object of beauty and could be used as an improvised bludgeoning weapon in extremis.
9. Plated in silver, this ornate scroll case decorated with etchings of interwoven geometric shapes is a work of art. At first glance, it appears to be worth 5 gp, but a careful examination reveals it to actually be worth 50 gp.
10. The two ends of this scroll case are connected by a three-foot-long length of rope. The two ends are pulled away from each other to reach the scroll within. One end of the case is painted blue; the other is painted red.
11. This supple scroll case comprises hundreds of highly polished tiny chain rings connected together in a similar fashion to chainmail.
12. Vilimzair Aralivar—legendary pirate captain and the world's greatest bard—once owned this ornate silver scroll case. The scene of a great sea battle during which Vilimzair heroically led his companions to victory aboard his enemy's flagship adorns the case. 





## WONDROUS STAVES 



1. Almost six-foot-long, this thick oak staff seems strangely twisted, as if rung out like a wet blanket. The grain of the wood twists around the staff in a spiral pattern.
2. Mystic symbols picked out in blue woad decorate the whole length of this four-foot long staff. Several of the symbols speak of home, hearth and health while others hint at the magical powers lurking within. From the staff's size, it looks like it was crafted for a gnome or halfling.
3. This slender staff is of smooth, polished white wood; it shimmers in the light and the air always seems fresh and airy in its immediate vicinity.
4. Knobbly and gnarled, bark still clings to various bits of this brownish-red staff. String of various colours and a couple of white swan feathers are tied to one end.
5. Five holes pierce the last few feet of this oaken staff. Each is tightly plugged with a different opaque stone glow with a sullen, perhaps threatening, glow.
6. As straight as a mast and highly polished, this staff is otherwise featureless except for four runes—one for each of the elements—beautifully etched into the wood. Perceptive characters also notice another rune—that for magic—carved into both ends of the staff.
7. This staff appears to be wooden, but a close examination reveals it to be of dull iron painted and etched to appear like wood. The staff is three times heavier than normal.
8. This staff comprises scorched and blackened wood. A fine layer of charcoal coats the burnt wood, and covers the hands of anyone carrying or touching the staff. The wood is vaguely warm to the touch.
9. This seemingly fragile staff comprises thick bands of coloured glass mimicking the colours found in the various prismatic spells: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
10. This short four-foot-long staff is crafted from a long, slightly curved bone. Perhaps the rib bone of some gigantic beast, the staff has symbols relating to death, destruction and unlife carved into its length.
11. Of blindingly bright white ash this plain, unadorned staff at first glance appears to be nothing particularly special. In the dark, however, it emits a soft white glow in a tenfoot radius; undead find this light disconcerting; mindless undead will not enter the area.
12. Once the haft of a legendary warrior wizard's spear used to slay a mighty dragon, this staff now contains the heroine's spirit. She possesses immense eldritch knowledge, and can telepathically speak with her owner. 

## WONDROUS UNHOLY SYMBOLS 



1. This unholy symbol has a secret compartment; it contains a single platinum piece minted in an ancient now fallen city state. Wrapped in scraps of cloth the coin does not rattle.
2. This holy symbol has a secret compartment; it contains scraps of bone and hair—remnants of a great hero of the faith. The owner believed they imbued the symbol with extra power.
3. This steel unholy symbol has one particularly sharp edge; close examination reveals dried blood smeared over the sharp edge.
4. This holy symbol bears several spikes. Close examination reveals a hidden compartment designed to hold poison which affects anyone stabbed or cut with the spikes. The compartment can hold two doses of lethal poison.
5. This unholy symbol at first appears to be of silver; however, it is too light to be solid silver; it is actually wood covered in silver paint and is essentially worthless.
6. This unholy symbol is ancient; the finer details have been worn smooth by time and use and the symbol is in poor repair.
7. This large, heavy symbol is made of some kind of dense, dark grey metal; it resists damage but has a long crack along one edge. The symbol was once the phylactery of a powerful lich in the service of the same dark power; if it was repaired, the lich might return to unlife.
8. This metal unholy symbol comprises the melted down remains of several holy symbols; some of their details yet remain. Observant characters can make out several different good-aligned defaced symbols in its body.
9. Large and unwieldy, this unholy symbol is sized for a giant. Clips allow the symbol to be “opened” and the whole to be worn as a necklace (or collar).
10. This unholy symbol hangs from a particularly long chain that allows it to be worn at navel height. Some of the chain's brutal links are dangerously thin.
11. This oversized symbol has a notch at its base. A weapon's haft can be inserted, which transforms the symbol into a jaggedly vicious mace or morningstar.
12. Imbued with the souls of those sacrificed to a dark power this unholy symbol is a thing of horror and blasphemy. The symbol ensnares the sacrifices' souls at the moment of their death. When used as a focus to cast a spell, the symbol lets forth a deluge of screams which sound like a veritable choir of the damned. The intensity of the screams depends on the level of the spell cast. 





## WONDROUS WANDS 



1. Of plain, unadorned iron this short, but heavy, wand has a large violet crystal set at its tip. Strange shadows move sluggishly within the crystal.
2. Intricate carvings of geometric shapes and esoteric glyphs decorate this long, slender wand of willow. Picked out with pigments of many hues the glyphs and shapes stand in stark relief to the plain white wood.
3. Holes of various sizes pierce this slender oaken wand. (The wand weighs only half as much as normal). Several red strings and a single length of faded yellow twine are woven through the holes.
4. Although it appears to be rotten almost to the point of collapse this wand is as tough as iron. The faint smell of mould hangs in the surrounding air. When the wand's powers are called forth, the wand's already dark hue deepens noticeably and small pieces of wood flake off.
5. Made of black cast iron, this long wand has been polished to a high sheen. Tapered to a wicked point at one end, it could easily be used as a weapon in extremis.
6. This iron wand comprises four strands of metal braided together in a style reminiscent of rope. At one end, the four strands come together to create a basket of sorts, which contains a lump of mottled grey granite.
7. Carved from the leg bone of some undoubtedly vicious (and certainly large) beast this wand is obviously ancient artifice. Yellowed by age and use, the bone is brittle.
8. Wrapped with strips of multi-coloured silk this wand is of obvious exotic artifice. Crafted from some sort of tremendously light wood it is easy to wield.
9. Crafted from a magically preserved icicle about the length of a man's forearm, this wand does not melt no matter how hot the surroundings become. Cold radiates from the wand and it shimmers and gleams in the light.
10. This two-foot-long piece of scorched oak is burnt almost to charcoal at its tip. It yet feels warm to the touch.
11. A silvery skull tops this short and heavy golden bar. Black gems—onyx—fill the skull's eyes and glow evilly when the wand's powers are employed.
12. Comprising contained and shaped mist rendered substantial through powerful magics this wand is cold and clammy to the touch. When its powers are used, the mist writhes and twists within its magical prison. 





# KOBOLD WARREN 



## WARREN DRESSING 



1. A few scraps of mottled blue and brown scales lie on the floor below a rocky protrusion in the wall.
2. Strange runes scrawled on the wall in the language of dragons speak of the kobolds' destiny to rule the world and their inevitable triumph over the “big folk”.
3. Crude drawings of a gigantic dragon surrounded by bowing and scrapping kobolds decorate the whole wall. The dragon is depicted as munching on something. Careful observation because reveals a tiny pair of legs sticking out of its mouth.
4. A coil of thin string lies neatly against one wall. One end is tied to a small iron peg hammered into the ground. The peg has been painted to blend in with its surrounds. A discarded hammer and another peg lie against the opposite wall.
5. A small pile of rubble—more the start of a breastwork— about three-foot-high partially blocks access to the area beyond. A broken spear sized for a kobold lies discarded on the floor. The spear is missing its tip; dried blood coats the shaft's upper portion.
6. A small carven niche in the wall holds a large horned skull that glowers down at all who pass. Investigation reveals the skull to be that of a minotaur.
7. A pile of rotting wood lies against one wall. It is riddled with centipedes and seems to almost writhe like some kind of sentient worm creature.
8. A ragged, filthy half-curtain hangs from the ceiling to about four-foot above the floor. The kobolds can easily move and see under the curtain but it obscures taller creatures' vision.
9. The heavy stench of wet dog and the faint smell of smoke hangs in the air. The smell is more pungent closer to the floor.
10. Water oozes down one wall into a small pool of scummy water. A ring of mould surrounds the pool, which is really nothing more than a large puddle. 

## WARREN EVENTS 



1. From around a corner, out of sight of the party, comes the quiet, furtive scrabbling sound of claw on stone.
2. A crossbow bolt whizzes out of the darkness toward the party. The bolt misses and skids down the corridor before splintering against the far wall.
3. The faint murmur of conversation suddenly cut short reaches the most perceptive—or perhaps most paranoid —character's ears. It seemed the conversation came from behind the party.
4. A sudden gust of wind fills the area, threatening to extinguish any nonmagical unprotected flames such as candles and torches.
5. The distinctive rattling of a chain breaks the relative quiet. Moments later, the party hears the thud of something heavy hitting the ground.
6. The faint smell of wet fur reaches the party's scout's nostrils. It grows stronger as the party proceed toward the next lurking defenders—perhaps providing a hint of imminent, impending danger.
7. A faint piping sound reaches the party's ears. It might be just the wind or it could be the kobolds communicating with each other. This latter theory seems much more likely as after a few moments, the piping begins from another, unexplored direction.
8. A clatter—like someone dropping a shield or weapon— echoes through the air.
9. A nearby, but hidden, kobold begins to taunt the characters. He starts in the language of the kobolds, but if no one understands him he switches to broken, highpitched Common. He questions the characters' skills and bravery, and dares them to “come and get me”.
10. A sudden breeze carries the scent of smoke and fire over the party. Perceptive characters hear the crackle of flames from somewhere up ahead. 





## WARREN TRAPS 



1. A jar filled with green slime is embedded into the ceiling. A metal rod fixed with wax in the jar's mouth keeps the slime in place (until an unsuspecting adventurer fiddles with the strange rod hanging down from the ceiling).
2. A tin box filled with spiders is hidden away where the floor meets the wall. Tripping over a simple wire strung through eyelets pulls back the box's lid releasing a tiny swarm of hungry spiders.
3. The top of a bellows is set into the floor and disguised as stone. A hidden tube connected to the bellows filled with flour erupts in a blinding cloud when anyone steps on it.
4. A small clay bowl filled with acid rests atop a high rotten shelf next to a small stack of copper coins. Disturbing the shelf causes it to collapse soaking whoever is under it in acid.
5. A seemingly shallow puddle hides a deeper section set with rusty broken knives pointing upwards.
6. A narrow shelf mounted on the opposite side of a door holds a jar of angry bees. When the door is opened, the jar falls and shatters.
7. This door is barred from this side as if to contain something within. Hidden in a hollowed-out portion of the bar is a venomous snake. Removing the bar releases the snake.
8. A small, rickety ladder leans on the wall just below an obvious trapdoor in the ceiling. The trapdoor opens to a small compartment holding an angry, hungry skunk.
9. Set in a small alcove just around a bend in the hall (or tunnel) is a chalkboard. Rigged to a tripwire is a pliable slat of wood with nails in it set to drag a screeching track across the chalkboard when triggered.
10. A large, hollow brass knob is set into a door. Pushed into the hollow of the knob from an opening on the other side is a piece of hot coal. The knob is searingly hot.
11. In the bottom of a covered pit are rows of sharpened stakes coated with snake poison. Someone falling into the pit is impaled on the stakes.
12. Among rubble and several wooden posts ostensibly holding up the ceiling lies a rucksack. Pulling the rucksack snaps two rigged posts. Large boulders fall where the pack lay crushing whoever disturbed that pack (and everyone else within a five-foot radius).
13. A net of cavern orb spider silk is set beneath tripwires connected to counterweights. When triggered, the net pulls victims upwards. A swarm of spiders living in the net then attack the ensnared intruders.
14. Earthenware jugs containing fermented troll excrement, pitch and honey are stacked up against the wall. The kobolds light a twine fuse as the party approach which shortly thereafter causes the jars to explode.
15. Mouldering meat fills a sack. If the bag is opened everything within five-foot is covered in virulent spores of the Cursed Miner's Cap fungus. The spores cause confusion among those infected.
16. The kobolds have put two starved snakes in upturned baskets and buried them in dust and light rubble before tying a tripwire between both baskets. When the tripwire is pulled, the upturned baskets release the snakes. They slither forth to assuage their hunger.
17. Ropes dangle down from a cliff or escarpment. Climbing them dislodges the boulders anchoring them, which tumble down to crush the falling climbers.
18. Crossing a narrow causeway causes an uneven boulder beneath to shift which releases a rope connected to a stone pillar. This pendulum swings down along the causeway sweeping aside all in its way.
19. A rickety bridge with phosphorous stones fastened beneath the walkway crosses low over a pit of water and pitch. The party's weight causes the stones to touch the water. The water reacts with the sulphur in the stones igniting the pitch and setting all it touches alight.
20. A rope bridge traversing a chasm ends at a gate. Once opened, the gate releases the bridge's tension ropes. This causes the bridge to collapse into the chasm below. 





## ABNORMAL KOBOLDS 




### APPEARANCE 



1. This kobold's scales are a deep rusty black, making it hard to spot when it lurks among the shadows.
2. While this kobold's scales are mainly a dark, rusty brown a swath of scales on its back has a deep, crimson hue.
3. A crude, dirty bandage encrusted with dried blood is wrapped around this kobold's right upper arm.
4. This kobold's ears have multiple tiny bone piercings. The bones—perhaps kobold finger bones—softly clack together when the kobold violently shakes its head.
5. Scars criss-cross this kobold's chest. Around each scar its scales are discoloured and sickly-looking.
6. This kobold wears an oversized patchwork poncho made up of small pieces of many different garments. Red, orange and yellow colours predominate.
7. With baleful, pale yellow eyes this kobold has the faint whiff of the demonic about it.
8. While its fellow all have long tails, this kobold's has been hacked off. Only a ragged stump remains.
9. This warrior has previously suffered a head wound. A dirty, bloody bandage is wrapped around its head. Blood oozes down its forehead and onto its left cheek.
10. Carrying a comically oversized axe, this kobold grunts and strains under the weight of its weapon. The battleaxe is of dwarven manufacture, and the kobold struggles to wield it effectively in battle. 

### BATTLE TACTICS 



1. Even more cowardly than normal, this kobold is terrified of the sight of blood. As soon as one of its fellows is injured, it flees.
2. This kobold knows how dangerous spellcasters can be; he targets them with missile weapons.
3. A bloodthirsty maniac, and a wanna-be hero, this kobold seeks out the largest enemy…and tries to stab him stealthily in the back.
4. Striking from hiding, this kobold is silent while he fights. Even when injured, he doesn't utter a sound—he has learnt that noise often brings death.
5. Initially, this warrior hangs back from battle. He waits for an enemy to fall before rushing in to administer a coup de grace.
6. A thief at heart, this kobold stops fighting to loot the bodies of the fallen, as soon as it is safe to do so.
7. Wearing a bandolier festooned with throwing daggers, this warrior hangs back from combat and hurls his weapons at isolated targets.
8. Confident of his own skills, this warrior attempts to goad enemies into making foolish attacks by yipping insults at them in his high-pitched voice.
9. Partly mad, this kobold can't stop laughing in battle— even when injured. He is fearless and fights to the death, even if the situation is hopeless.
10. This kobold bears a grudge against one of his fellows. If he gets the chance, he surreptitiously stabs his enemy in the back. 

### TRINKETS & TREASURES 



1. A few rat bones, pieces of fluff and three short lengths of frayed rope.
2. A small blunt knife, a set of partially carved bone dice and 3 cp.
3. A partially eaten, mouldering rat corpse and a thin, broken gold ring (worth 5 gp if repaired).
4. This bloodstained pouch contains a bent iron spike and a dirty steel mirror.
5. Several small albino mushrooms wrapped in fungus along with 6 cp.
6. Four sling bullets of dwarven craft, flint and steel and a shredded water flask.
7. The rusted hilt of a dagger, three sharp rock shards and the mouldering remains of a rat corpse.
8. A necklace of rat skulls decorated with flakes of rock.
9. A heavy iron key, the stub of a small candle and 1 sp.
10. Four pieces of chalk, three fishhooks and a short length of twine. 






## LOOTING A DEAD KOBOLD 



1. A half-eaten rat wrapped in a scrap of dirty gore-stained brown cloth.
2. A tangle of strings—of varying colours and lengths—fill this small pouch. Hidden deep within the ball lurks a shiny black pebble.
3. This kobold has hoarded much wealth; in the pouch, the characters find four silver coins—tarnished and bent—a dozen coppers and a single dirty gold piece bent almost in half.
4. This kobold carries a rudimentary tripwire—a length of thin string wrapped around two small wooden pegs—in his pouch along with a length of tiny copper bells that can be wrapped around the tripwire.
5. Four half-burnt candles along with a much-used flint and steel wrapped carefully in a strip of sackcloth.
6. A broken dagger—sized for a human—whose blade ends in a jagged stump. The shard of the blade—covered in dried blood—is also in the pouch.
7. The kobold wore a crude necklace crafted from finger bones; some still have fingernails attached.
8. The kobold wore comically oversized boots—obviously once worn by a human. To make them fit, he has padded them out with rags. Hidden in the rags are three worn silver coins.
9. The kobold wore a bandolier from which hang many small securely stoppered flasks. Each is filled with a noxious substance—excrement, rank water, vomit and so on. The flasks are flimsy and designed to break apart when they hit something solid.
10. An almost empty wine flask along with the bodies of several large spiders fills the kobold's pouch. Each of the spiders has had their legs removed and one of the bodies is half-eaten.
11. A small pouch worn around the kobold's neck contains four teeth—one broken—a selection of smooth pebbles and a dirty grey feather.
12. The kobold wore the remnants of a white silk undershirt. The undershirt has been cut off at the waist and arms to fit the kobold and is filthy (and odorous). It is valueless to the characters, but several other members of the tribe have had their eye on the garment for some time. The characters could use it as a bribe or may even see several warriors fighting over the shirt if they return to the scene of this battle without looting the shirt.
13. Hidden in a bulging pouch, the character finds many rags wrapped around a broken mirror. Half of the glass is missing and if the character searches without being careful they may cut themselves on the glass shards.
14. The kobold carried the remains of a tattooing kit in a well-made leather pouch. Clearly oversized for the kobold, the pouch contains two (bloody) needles, three small vials of ink—black, blue and red—and several crude doodles of the kobolds' tribal sigil.
15. A ripped section of damp fishing net woven about three short lengths of rope fills a sack hanging from the kobold's belt.
16. The kobold wore a tarnished silver-plated signal whistle (worth 2 gp) on a short length of filthy leather twine around its neck.
17. An empty flask smelling of strong spirits and several sheets of stained parchment fill the kobold's pouch.
18. A mummified, but rank, rat paw stuck transfixed on a piton. Dried blood covers the rat's claws, which has stained the pouch holding the gruesome trophy.
19. A ragged belt pouch holds the ornate silvered hilt of a dagger. The blade is missing, but the hilt is worth 15 gp.
20. This kobold has amassed a small collection of smooth shells. Each has been pierced through its centre and a threaded silver wire holds them all together. The wire is worth 2 gp, and the whole thing can be worn as a necklace (if one is Small-sized). 





# LICH' S LAIR 



## OUTSIDE THE LAIR 



1. An ever-present light fog redolent of some nameless, heady spice lingers in the lair's vicinity. The fog does not hinder vision overly, but living creatures spending much time in its depths suffer from watering eyes and mild sneezing fits.
2. Skulls, bones and other gruesome remains litter the ground in the vicinity of the lich's lair. The closer one gets to the entrance, the deeper and more prevalent are the remains. Some of the bones are obviously old, while others appear relatively recent.
3. The trees, bushes and other foliage in the lair's immediate vicinity are warped and stunted. Of unwholesome and ill-looking appearance even their hues seem odd or unnatural.
4. Rubble and stones that once comprised some kind of elaborate building lie scattered about the ground surrounding the lair's entrance. Some of the rubble sports aged and weather-worn ornate scrollwork.
5. The trail leading to the lair is worn smooth as if by the action of countless feet. Here and there, scraps of mouldy or rusting equipment lie scattered about.
6. Wisps of darkness dribble from the lich's lair. They waft gently upwards into the sky like smoke before evaporating into nothingness.
7. No animal will approach within several hundred yards of the lich's tomb. Adventurers with a strong connection to nature—druids, rangers and elves in particular—sense death lurking in the chill air.
8. So much evil magic lurks in the lich's lair that it has poisoned the surrounds. Vegetation is grey, almost colourless, and crumbles into dust if touched. The soil holds no moisture or fertility. Nothing healthy grows here. 

## WHISPERS & RUMOURS 



1. The lich is surpassingly dangerous—as is its lair. Within, the very walls and the air itself can come alive to slay intruders. Countless adventurers have died screaming in its lair.
2. While yet alive, the lich battled dragons in pursuit of their ancient lore and mounded treasure. The lich took trophies from each of its kills to decorate its lair and enchanted some of the slain dragons as undead servitors and/or puissant magical traps.
3. Obsessed with its unlife, the lich researches even more powerful states of unending life. It pays handsomely for tomes of lore or esoteric components to aid its research; thus not all who brave its lair are immediately slain.
4. The lich has developed fell magics to split a target's soul from its body. It imprisons souls in specially prepared gems; once a soul is captured, the unfortunate becomes the lich's slave or is blasted into oblivion.
5. Merciless and drenched in evil, the lich takes particular delight in torturing and tempting paladins and goodaligned clerics. Any such folk surviving the lich's attentions are forever changed...
6. Growing increasingly paranoid the lich has long since fled to an even more hidden and warded locale. It has left many fell servants in its old lair to punish those who dared to believe they could best it. 





## LICH LAIR TRINKETS 



1. This worn and ancient skull has had its top removed and its eye sockets, mouth and nose blocked up with melted iron. A golden skull cap now tops the skull, which contains a flask's worth of unholy water.
2. A faded portrait, covered in grime, dust and cobwebs depicts the lich as it was in life. A dusty blanket has been thrown over the picture and its heavy, ornate frame.
3. The rent remains of a ripped and bloody sack lie on the ground. Smears of blood and viscera cover the surrounding floor. A single, now mouldering, finger wearing a cheap brass ring lies folded in the sack's remains. The finger bone is cleanly sheared off.
4. Several potion vials sit on a dusty shelf. Over the years, their stoppers have rusted or shrunk, and the potions within have slowly evaporated leaving behind a dried scum coating the bottom of each vial.
5. Brightly polished steel shields cover one wall. All identifying marks have been scoured from their surfaces, which are almost as polished as a mirror.
6. A strange, musty odour redolent of rotting flesh and moist earth hangs in the air. In certain deep or remote parts of the lich's lair, the smell is almost overpowering. The smell emerges from a seemingly simple clay bottle (which radiates magic of an indeterminate sort).
7. A pile of dusty manuscripts, portfolios and other books stand near the lich's workspace. Untouched for years— perhaps decades—the pile sags precariously to one side.
8. An ornately carved stone sarcophagus holds the mouldering remains of the lich's first love. The lich is reluctant to simply animate the remains; instead it has been researching how to create an intelligent skeleton with a range of powers befitting the person's life. Its research notes along with love poems and rambling tracts about how much the lich misses its love fill a large leather bound book standing on a lectern nearby.
9. A small ornately carved iron box filled with rune-covered scraps of parchment lies behind a poorly hidden secret door. This is the lich's decoy phylactery; its real phylactery is hidden elsewhere.
10. A partially melted silver torc of archaic design lies discarded on the floor. Half the torc is missing, and the rest is horribly damaged; it only has value as scrap metal. 

## HORRIBLE SPELL COMPONENTS 



1. Burnt scraps of leathery parchment intermixed with a dried powdery residue of bone and blood fill a small crudely wrought and dented iron bowl. The writing on the parchment is (luckily) illegible.
2. A boiled and shrunken head, its features set into a terrible rictus of fear, is displayed on an iron stand atop a small plinth. The head's glassy, mostly lifeless, eyes stare into the room—as perhaps they have done for years without counting. The head looks like it might once have belonged to a human male.
3. A small iron statuette shows a devil and an angel in a lusty embrace. The statuette is incredibly—scandalously— detailed and depicts an act so vile paladins and the like, or those with particularly sensitive souls, might openly weep at the blasphemy it depicts.
4. The powdered remains of a variety of different-hued gems mixed with a blood paste decorate the floor in the shape of a certain terrible and forbidden rune dealing with eternal undeath.
5. A humanoid's spinal cord; its various bones are daubed in red and purple paint. There seems to be a pattern of sorts, but its purpose is maddeningly unclear.
6. A bone flask seems suspiciously heavy for its size. The vial has a black stone stopper etched with the symbol for the soul. Within the container, the characters discover a thick, viscous black liquid that defies identification.
7. A long leg bone painstakingly etched with rust-red runes dealing with death, undead and control. (The runes are picked out with a specially prepared blood paste).
8. A beautifully woven rug rolled tightly into a tube and wrapped in oilskin. The rug has a bafflingly complex, and for some reason disturbing, pattern woven into it with silver thread. A faint, exotic scent hangs in the air around the rug.
9. This dagger is obviously used as a sacrificial item. Carved from a monstrous tusk its tip is thick with dried blood and viscera. Its pommel holds a dull black, jagged chunk of onyx that seems to suck in the light.
10. This large, once unimaginably valuable and beautiful, diamond is riven by a multitude of cracks. It seems impossible the gemstone is still mostly in one piece. A chunk of stone is missing from one side, and a strange, unwholesome grey mist slowly dribbles from the remaining stone. (This was once the centrepiece of a rival lich's phylactery, but the lich used it to power his own “ascendancy” to undeath.) 





## LICH LAIR DRESSING 



1. Splintered and scorched bones, wisps and scraps of equipment and death's faint miasma fill the area. The walls are similarly pitted and burned; powerful magic was once unleashed here. The carnage is impressive; perhaps a dozen people died in the conflagration.
2. Shadows haunt the lair's nooks and crannies; mundane light has trouble banishing them. The whole place feels claustrophobic as the darkness clusters thickly about the characters' lights.
3. Tiny floating motes of glimmering multi-hued light float through the air. In some places, the motes are attracted to the characters (or perhaps the warmth of their life force) while in others the characters repel them. When a mote touches warm flesh, it explodes into non-existence.
4. Crumbling mortar and fallen stones have revealed a hidden niche cut into one wall. A gallimaufry of dusty skulls and bones have tumbled from the choked hole and spilt onto the floor. Investigations reveal many of the bones bear unmistakable signs of violence.
5. Fell arcane runes of unspeakable evil decorate the walls. Burnt into the very stones themselves the runes are jagged and harsh. Some of the jagged holes in the rock are surprisingly deep—deep enough for a foolish (or brave) explorer to thrust his fingers all the way inside...
6. Fine grey dust coats the floor; knowledgeable characters can determine the dust is akin to that created by a disintegrate spell. The characters discover another grey pile in the next area they explore.
7. A broken pick juts from the lock on the next door the characters find. The pick has jammed the lock; it must be removed if the door is to be opened without being broken down.
8. The ceiling sags alarmingly; dust and grit sift down from between the stones onto the floor. Faint marks in the dust suggest someone or something passed this way recently. If the characters pass underneath, the stones grind and groan dropping more dust and grit onto the characters' heads.
9. Dead rats and spiders coat the floor in a veritable carpet of death. Many of the creatures seem frozen; their bodies are brittle and crack open if stood upon. From the position of the hundreds of corpses, it looks like the rats and spiders were locked in a titanic battle. Dusty cobwebs hang from the ceiling almost to the floor.
10. A once-majestic fresco adorns a wall. Great rents in the mural now show where someone bashed it with a heavy object. Shattered plaster lies mounded against the wall.
11. A mass of jumbled bones completely fills a deep niche cut into the floor. Several grinning skulls stare up from the macabre spectacle. The remains of literally dozens of individuals lie within the niche.
12. The ceiling is painted jet black. Onto this has been daubed a star map. With extensive study, a knowledgeable character discovers the map depicts a rare alignment of constellations that will not occur for another 300 years.
13. An ornately forged brass wand with a burnt-out blue gemstone at its tip lies discarded on the floor. Forged to look like a fork of lightning, the wand is an impractical shape for easy storage. The first character to touch the item feels a faint tingling in their hand; perhaps the wand's magic is not entirely depleted.
14. Incongruously, a single jet black brick of preternaturally smooth stone juts out one inch from the wall. The stone could be the trigger for a trap, nothing in particular or perhaps the keystone for some kind of powerful magic.
15. The next door the characters encounter is strengthened with scorched panels of beaten brass engraved with several horrible runes. Knowledgeable characters can determine the runes were part of a magical trap (which has —probably—already been triggered).
16. Glimmering stones set in a sprawling pattern decorate much of the ceiling. The stones glimmer and sparkle in the party's lights like stars. Investigations reveal the stones each protrude slightly from the rest of the ceiling and; graven runes decorate several of the stones. A knowledgeable character realises the glimmering stones represent a star map. Perceptive characters spot a single black stone set among the others; the stone is placed where no star is known to shine.
17. Scrawled on the wall in dried and smudged blood are the words, “We should not have come here.” The writing grows fainter toward the end of the sentence as if the person writing it grew tired (or ran out of blood).
18. A statue, depicting the lich in life, stands on a small plinth in a wall niche. The niche is cut so the statue can see the whole area. The walls and plinth are partially melted—as if they had been subjected to a powerful acid-based attack—and the statue's head and one arm lie shattered on the ground.
19. The remains of a shattered potion vial lie on the floor against one wall. Dust and grime coat the glass remains, which have been here for many years. Strangely, when first spotted, several of the glass shards seem to sparkle with some kind of unnatural silvery radiance.
20. A narrow, rough-hewn staircase pierces the floor. The stair ends in an impenetrable rockfall. The words, “Not this way” are daubed in blood on the top step. Perceptive note the words are best read from the direction of the collapse. 





## STRANGE SMELLS & SOUNDS 



1. A booming sound—akin to that of mighty waves breaking against a beach—fill the air. The sound is rhythmic— perhaps even hypnotic to those with weak wills or who are easily distracted.
2. The faint, but heady, scent of roses hangs in the air. Characters sniffing the air get a sudden image of impossibly vast black and red roses swaying in the night air at the edge of a fecund jungle.
3. The clacking of bone on stone—a skeleton skulking just out of sight—reaches the ears of the most perceptive characters. A few moments later, the loud clatter of bones collapsing to the floor splits the air.
4. A deep, mournful sigh, redolent with despair and melancholy, washes over the party. For a moment, it seems like the lair itself is beset by sorrow.
5. All around the party, the air comes alive with the sound of crackling, sizzling electricity. Hairs stand up on the characters' necks and the back of their arms. The smell of ozone accompanies the sound; perceptive characters may even hear faint, seemingly distant, screams that fade away as the smell slowly dissipates.
6. A distant, powerful voice, redolent with power and fell intent, rises into a fiendish cackle before slowly fading away into a low cackle.
7. The overpowering smell of formaldehyde and other unidentifiable, but foul-smelling chemicals, hangs into the air. Investigation reveals the stench emerges from a deep crack cutting across two walls.
8. The rattling of chains and the low moaning of a creature in terrible pain reaches the party. It slowly fades away, no matter which way the party move.
9. At seemingly random intervals, a loud chime—a single, chilling note that seems to grate on the characters' souls —sounds throughout the complex.
10. A loud dripping sound comes from around the next corner. As the characters approach, the sound speeds up. When they round the corner, the characters discover a large, irregularly-shaped puddle of blood on the floor. As the characters watch, blood dripping from the ceiling feeds the puddle.
11. The repugnant stench of rotten eggs and meat is strong here. The smell is worse closer to the floor; weaklystomached halfling and gnome explorers could even be overcome by the stench and become violently ill.
12. With no warning, the ear-splitting sound of a mighty gong being repeatedly struck with a heavy mallet assails the party. The sound is near deafening and makes conversation all but impossible. The sound lasts for half a minute or so before abruptly ceasing. 

## STRANGE SENSATIONS & EVENTS 



1. The temperature is only just above freezing in this area; the characters' breath is visible in the air. The cold is unnatural, and those with a strong connection to nature— druids, elves and rangers in particular—are most afflicted by the effect.
2. The party's light sources—even permanent magical effects—flicker as if caught in a strong wind. Mundane sources of light are extinguished by the strange effect.
3. One of the characters becomes certain an unseen watcher is observing the party. The feeling does not dissipate until the party leaves the lair.
4. A sudden sharp, stabbing chest pain, causes one of the characters to double over in agony. No wound is evident, but it takes several minutes for the pain to pass.
5. One of the characters' vision blurs and grows dim. For the afflicted character, it is as if all the lights had suddenly gone out. (This might be particularly disconcerting for those normally able to see in the dark).
6. Wisps of shadow descend from a corner where the ceiling meets two walls. The wisps float down as if drawn to the party's lights. Once they touch a light source (magical or mundane), they fade into nothingness.
7. Each characters' largest metal possession—probably a suit of armour, shield or weapon—begins to vibrate subtly. After a minute the vibration increases in intensity before abruptly ceasing. Afterwards, the object remains slightly magnetised for 1d4 hours.
8. If the characters use light sources, their shadows appear more blurred and indistinct than usual—as if some unseen barrier stood between them and the light. The effect is particularly pronounced with non-magical lights.
9. A blood-red rune slowly coalesces on one wall. The rune is massive—easily the height of a grown man. As the party watch, it begins to move and writhe like a snake. The rune is identifiable as the lich's personal glyph.
10. The shadows cast in this area do not seem to completely match the movements of the creatures making them. It is almost like there is a slight delay before the shadow mimics the action.
11. A single gleaming platinum coin hangs suspended in the air. The coin is immobile and cannot be moved without powerful magic; strange images of a haughty man with small horns growing from his forehead decorate one side of the coin; the representation of an immense tower adorns the obverse.
12. Iron face masks adorn the walls. As the party approach, the masks animate—the faces contorted into expressions of horrible pain and terror. Perceptive characters notice one mask is different—of a doughty dwarf it appears to be trying to mouth words at the party. 





## LICH' S PHYLACTERIES 



1. This hinged plain iron amulet opens to reveal a small, seemingly empty recess, perhaps once used to hold a small picture of a loved one. The recess is actually a tiny inter-dimensional space that can only be accessed by speaking the lich's name. This space contains the lich's research it used for its transformation.
2. This seemingly rusted iron comb was once apparently inlaid with several small gems, but these have long since fallen from their fixings. The comb is hidden in plain sight, amid a pile of mouldering and rusty equipment taken from corpses of the lich's enemies.
3. A seemingly innocuous platinum coin lies among a hoard of similar coins hidden away in a dusty vault. The coin is one of a handful of ancient coins intermixed among more recent designs. Most of its features have been worn away through use and age.
4. A lump of magically hardened platinum lies at the centre of a large stone boulder created by stone shape. The boulder is so thick, detect magic and the like do not detect the phylactery's magic, although a perceptive character may notice the rock was formed by magic (and wonder why).
5. This phylactery takes the form of an oversized amulet. It hangs from the mouldering collar worn by a huge skeletal dog lying in state in its own sarcophagus hidden in a secret recess in the floor.
6. This lich used the very first dagger it owned as the vehicle for its transformation. It etched the secrets of lichdom onto very thin sheets of gold which were then wrapped around the weapon's blade. The phylactery was then thrown into a deep pool somewhere in the lich's lair.
7. An animal lover in life, this lich decided to use the animated bones of its first animal companion—or perhaps a beloved pet—as its phylactery. The bones were drenched in molten adamantine before being animated.
8. Diamond—one of the hardest substances known to man— makes an excellent phylactery. This lich spent years hunting down a diamond as big as a man's fist. Magically enchanted and inscribed with various special command words the value of the thing is virtually incalculable… unless it is destroyed in which case the magic lurking within its form causes it to evaporate like ice in the midday sun.
9. Vastly powerful, this spellcaster defeated a saintlike paladin during its quest for immortality. The paladin bore a holy sword that was shattered during the confrontation. The lich used the hilt of the weapon as its phylactery, revelling in the irony of transforming such a potent good-aligned weapon into an object powering its unholy life. To make matters worse the hilt is distinctive—carved from the bone of a balor and inscribed with the symbols of various good-aligned deities; the characters may recognise it as the shards of a legendary, lost weapon. The lich has kept the shattered piece of the blade and in extremis may offer up the various shard in exchange for its “life” (gambling the characters either hesitate to destroy such a weapon or— more likely—not notice the lich's sinister modifications to the hilt).
10. This lich painstakingly etched the secrets of lichdom onto the teeth of a great gold wyrm it slew centuries ago as part of its transformation. It keeps the wyrm's skeletal remains behind a cunning hidden secret door. The skull lies amid a massed bone pile comprising the remains of all those who have attacked the lich in its lair. 





# LOCAL LANDMARKS 


## BEACHES & BAYS 



1. Bleak Cove: Accessible only by the stout ropes left by fishermen and egg-hunters, this hidden cove has a foreshore replete with deep rock pools. Samphire grows in profusion on the cliffs and many seabirds nest here. At high tide, the beach is almost completely inundated.
2. Willithar's Cave: Low tide reveals a wide swath of rippled sand, and allows access to a part-flooded sea cave buried at the base of the cliffs. A chasm in the rocks above the cave lets light penetrate the cavern when the sun reaches its zenith. Mackerel swarm offshore.
3. Beacon Hill: A tumbled tower tops this blustery headland. Only the tower's ground floor remains intact, and sometimes travellers shelter here from bad weather. Three cairns—said to be the resting place of drowned mariners—wreathed in wildflowers lie back from the cliff.
4. Elina's Arch: A dramatic triangular rock arch overlooks this wind-swept beach dotted with deep rock pools; many large crabs dwell within the pools and locals comes here to catch them. An elderly druid was reputed to live in a cave under the rock arch, but she has not been seen in many years.
5. Deep Plunge: This high waterfall, with a deep plunge pool at its lip, spills onto a sheltered shingle beach.
6. The Muckle: This blowhole pierces a great slab of rock dominating a wide shingle beach. The Muckle blows every time a wave of sufficient force reaches the beach. The origin of the blowhole's name is lost to time.
7. Namantor: Sand dunes rising up to rolling hills back this long, shallow beach. Rocky headlands bound the bay, and at low tide, the sea retreats a quarter-mile leaving a glistening swath of rippled golden sand. Minke whales and basking sharks cruise offshore.
8. Lonely Island Beach: This uninhabited rocky island lies a few hundred meters offshore from a narrow, sheltered beach. During storms, huge waves break over the island, sweeping it clear of all vegetation and structures. A tower once perched atop the island; now nothing but tumbled stone blocks and a partially sand-filled, flooded cellar remains.
9. The Golden Cliffs: Majestic west-facing cliffs tower over this narrow shingle beach. Several half-sunken stone huts of ancient artifice perch atop the cliffs and afford incredible views of the setting sun. A sunken track leads to the huts which are virtually invisible from the land.
10. The Drunk Man: This towering sea stack stands as high as the nearby cliffs. Linked to the mainland by a narrow shelf of rock that disappears at high tide, the 200-foothigh Drunk Man has a curious, lopsided look—the result of endless waves battering its base. High up and inaccessible, several narrow caves—the burial niches of a forgotten people—pierce the stack.
11. Church Island: A battered stone causeway, only useable at low tide, connects this tidal island to the mainland. Extensive ruins on the island are the tumbled remnants of a monastery dedicated to the Storm Mistress. The monastery was sacked by raiders a century ago. In the winter, puffins nest on the island's rocky shores.
12. Wreckers' Cove: A narrow islet stands at the confluence of several powerful ocean currents. Consequently, the chill waters of this narrow cove are often thick with flotsam, jetsam and wreckage. Beachcombers scavenge here for valuable items amongst the sea's leavings. Sometimes bloated corpses wash ashore, here.
13. Bone Beach: Fast-eroding cliffs overlook this sandy beach. A chapel once stood on the cliffs, but it collapsed onto the beach long ago. Now, the chapel's graveyard is falling prey to the sea and perceptive visitors can make out bones jutting from the cliffs and littering the beach. Legends of ghosts, hauntings and sinister doings hover thickly about Bone Beach.
14. The Three Sisters: Three jagged sea stacks tower above a wild, rugged beach. Powerful riptides lurk just offshore making waterborne investigations of the Three Sisters difficult and dangerous.
15. Passage Cove: This small cove boasts a narrow tunnel hewn through the surrounding cliffs by long-dead smugglers. The gently shelved sandy beach is a perfect spot to bring ashore contraband and the like.
16. Short Sands: Crudely carven steps provide access to this wild, sandy beach interspaced with rocky shelves. A grotto pierces the cliffs and a dilapidated stone cottage overlooks the beach.
17. Jetty Cove: A stone jetty juts out into this sheltered cove's waters. A substantial rambling stone building stands at the end of the jetty and is home to an extended family of slightly inbred fisherfolk. The family do not tolerate guests, and wild rumours accuse them of smuggling, wrecking and worse.
18. Sea Queen's Grotto: A large tidal cave pierces the cliffs at the base of this inaccessible stretch of shingle beach. Inside the grotto, a large stone throne—or at least a chunk of rock that looks suspiciously like a throne—rises from the grotto's pool. Locals often throw offerings into the sea from atop the cliffs to placate the fey sea queen said to dwell therein. A crude pile of stones atop the cliffs marks the spot directly above the grotto's entrance.
19. Strangler's Head: Named for a grisly murder years ago this spit of land commands sweeping views.
20. Mermaid's Haven: Local legend has it that mermaids come to this secluded bay to cavort at the summer solstice. A rock arch stands to the east; at dawn on the summer solstice, the sun shines through the arch, bathing the whole beach in golden light. 





## HILLS & HIGHLANDS 



1. Chapel Hill: The crumbling ruins of an old chapel stand atop this wooded, cliff-flanked hill. Barely visible through the trees, the chapel is a small, humble affair. Rumours of ancient hidden crypts below the ruin abound among local folk.
2. Bone Point: This splintered spur of rock juts outwards from the surrounding hills. From some angles, the spur looks like a broken leg bone—hence its name. A skirmish was fought here along ago when a band of raiding orcs were trapped and killed on the hill. Their weathering bones still lie amid the hill's sparse undergrowth.
3. The Giant's Wall: Surrounding by mature oaks and elms alive with birdsong and topped by a thick hedge of brambles and gorse this earthwork encircles a bare hilltop. Perceptive explorers can discover the vague outline of a building atop the hill, but whatever was here has long since rotted away.
4. Jumpers' Lake: Now a lake this once-quarry fills a hidden, grassy amphitheatre. Rock ledges—perfect for sunning one's self or jumping from—surround the lake. In the summer months, locals come here to swim and relax.
5. Crystal Caverns: Three cathedral-sized caverns, handcut by dwarves long ago, radiated outwards from the crystal-clear aquamarine waters of a subterranean lake. Sometimes brave locals explore the sloped entrance cavern and swim in the lake, but none have dared the deep caves in years.
6. Dunholm: Built into the cliff ages past Dunholm was once linked to ground level by a precarious stone stair, but this collapsed several decades ago. Rubble from the stair lies scattered on the ground below Dunholm, which is now abandoned. A local family owns the surrounding land, and would happily part with Dunholm if the price was right.
7. Star Hill: This conical hill offers incredible views of the surroundings and the night sky. Astronomers, wizards and other folk obsessed with the stars come here on cloudless nights to gaze up at the sky and make their calculations or plot their schemes. Sometimes fires blaze atop Star Hill, and when they do the common folk stay well away.
8. Dread Drop Quarry: Cut into the side of a hill, this deep quarry pit is named for the likely fate of anyone straying too close to the edge. Strong winds often gust around the hill, and more than one walker has told of being suddenly thrust toward the pit by an unseen force.
9. Salmon Leap: Nestled in a hollow between several hills, numerous tiny streams feed these five linked plunge pools which cascade into one another. For much of the year, the water's temperature in the pools is barely above freezing.
10. Finale's Leap: Legend has it, the mad gnome Finale built a small clapper-style bridge over this narrow, deep gorge to escape a pursuing demon. When the demon rushed across the bridge the stone cracked in the middle and the demon fell into the gorge where it has remained trapped ever since. Wherever the truth of the story, the bridge's splintered remains yet jut out across the gorge.
11. Hound Rock: Viewed from certain angles, this strangelyshaped chunk of bare stone looks like a dog's head.
12. Windy Ridge: Concentric rings of earthworks surround a chunk of rock rearing from the surrounding hills. The ridge itself has a wide and deep sunken hollow at its centre that allowed the people once dwelling here to escape the murderous wind at this exposed spot. Careful searching of the hollow reveals the presence of post holes, long lines of overgrown stones that may have once been walls and the like. 





## HOUSES & HOMES 



1. Jorma's Hut: This quirky hut, built from the remains of several wagons, is home to Jorma Markku (CN old male human). Jorma is widely regarded as mad—not least because of his penchant for dressing up like a dryad, prancing about the woods and spouting terrible poetry at all those unfortunate enough to encounter him.
2. The Bush Inn: Once a noble's hunting lodge, this stockaded building now serves as a traveller's inn. An air of decrepitude hangs over the place, and many of the outbuildings are in danger of collapse. The canny landlord—Riku Purho (N middle-aged male human thief
4) lives here with his large family and maintains ties with several local bandit gangs.
3. White Mill: Named for the raging waters powering its wheel, this picturesque mill house and cluster of four cottages stand hard against the banks of a swiftly flowing river. The miller—Tuevo Rintala (LN male human wizard 5) —is also a keen alchemist and uses the mill to power his experiments. The cottages house his workers, two apprentices and several mercenary guards.
4. Tower Hermitage: A mostly ruined chapel lurks in the midst of a small wood. The chapel's tower was once a small keep and is still largely intact. A hermit—Viljo Itkonen (LG middle-aged male human cleric [Darlen] 6) lives within and works to slowly rebuild the ruin. He welcomes visitors—but refuses all help with his task which he sees as atonement for some past sin of which he will not speak.
5. The Stag's Head: Standing amid walled orchards of plum, pear and apple trees the Stag's Head is widely renowned for its ciders. A fire is always reputed to be burning in the Stag's Head's hearth. The inn's two common rooms are replete with souvenirs of the hunt— stuffed bears', wolves' and deers' heads hang from their walls. The centrepiece—an immense 18-point set of deer's antlers—hang above the inn's main bar.
6. Tithe House: This stout stone building is in excellent repair, but stands empty. It overlooks a lonely stretch of road and sometimes travellers use it to shelter overnight. A sign written in Common encourages folk using the house to leave a tithe for the privilege. Legend has it, mischievous pixies live in the house, and traveller's sleeping within without paying a tithe often find their coin purses gone when they awake.
7. Thorn Keep: At the end of a potholed sunken lane, screened by an overgrown hedge and field of thistles and brambles, stands Thorn Keep. The castle is a shell keep and was built long ago by the crown to protect the area from bandits and raiders. A poor knight—Laila Salonen (LG middle-aged female human paladin 4) is lord of Thorn Keep. She commands a paltry garrison of 17 men-at-arms.
8. Stony Heap: Once a large stone-lined barrow, this home has been extensively dug out, renovated and expanded by a family of gnomes who care nothing for the strange rumours of odd-doings that local people attribute to the site. The barrow-home stands at one end of a grassy meadow which the gnomes use to graze their cattle and grow vegetables and the like. The family, led by their matriarch Erfanna Raeren (LG middle-aged female gnome illusionist 3), are friendly and welcome guests.
9. The Shaded Steps: A winding set of cut and dressed stone steps zig zag downwards into a shadowed, deepsided sinkhole. A stone cottage stands at the bottom of the stair by a tranquil pool of pure water fed by water dripping down into the sinkhole. The cottage is a front for a small cave system descending deeper into the earth. The friendly, but reserved, Armas Laitnen (CG middle-aged male human werebear), dwells here. Armas can control his condition and does not reveal his heritage except in extremis.
10. Rock Inn: Built between two chunks of rock rearing from the ground, Rock Inn is aptly named. Under the inn's thatched roof, Erivar Farnoen (LN male dwarf fighter 3) bids visitors relax in the cramped common room. Rock Inn is well known for its Warren Pie—its famous rabbit pie —and strong dwarven ales brewed in the inn's extensive naturally chilled cellars. 





## RUINS & REMNANTS 



1. Barrow Clump: Wreathed with a dense crown of gnarled and twisted oaks, hornbeams and elms, this rocky, time-worn hill is widely believed to be a burial place of the Old Folk.
2. Sparkwell: Legendry hangs thickly about this secluded water-filled shaft of unknown depth. Reputedly the site of an ancient battle between powerful wizards both swallowed by the ground itself at the height of their struggle strange events are often reported here. In the recent past, mists and scintillating lights of strange, otherworldly hues, have been reported emerging from the well's waters.
3. The Dancing Pools: Three deep, spring-fed pools nestle in the centre of a wide set of 56 standing stones. Some of the stones lie on their sides, and many of them yet bare faded pictograms of animals, birds and the like. A few larger pictograms, not visible from ground level, atop the standing stones depict things of altogether more sinister mien. Druids sometimes come here to enact their wild, orgiastic rites.
4. The Hanging Pit: A crude stone bridge buttressed at both ends spans this natural 30-foot deep chasm. A hanging scaffold once protruded from the bridge, but this has long since rotted away. In olden days those condemned to death were brought here to be hung—the long drop gifting instant death to the condemned. Wind blown detritus and bones cover the pit's floor.
5. Gillon's Pit: Overgrown ruins surround the remains of this failed mining venture. The mine's main passage descends steeply into the cliff for about 100 feet before ending in a collapse. Several side galleries radiate outwards from the main tunnel, but none venture any appreciable distance into the cliffs. Bats dwell in the mine and come forth at night to hunt the surrounding woodlands. Local legends whisper of vampires and ghosts dwelling in the mine.
6. Warren Tower: Extensive rabbit warrens and badger sets riddle the ground under this r u i n e d w i z a r d ' s tower. Local legend tells how the wizard once dwelling therein was engaged in blasphemous experiments and that the local druids objected to his foul practises. Their rabbit servants undermined the tower so much that it collapsed, killing the wizard and destroying his experiments.
7. The Old Mine House: Standing near an old, played-out mine this small stone building is the only occupied building in a small hamlet of ramshackle buildings. Norren Dwojyr (LN female dwarf fighter 2) lives here and believes there is wealth yet to be pulled out of the nearby mine.
8. Deer Bridge: Nothing more than a length of long, smooth stone this clapper-style bridge crosses a swiftly flowing stream just upstream from a deep plunge pool perfect for swimming. The bridge is undeniably ancient but sturdy.
9. Long Barrow: Dug into the side of a grassy knoll this ancient stone barrow has three side chambers radiating from a central crawlway. Adventurers have repeatedly explored Long Barrow and it is widely assumed nothing of value remains within. A double line of carven stone obelisks—some now leaning at drunken angles—lead up to the barrow's entrance.
10. Stone Wood: A wild river flows through this atmospheric and ancient stretch of woodland which clings to a steep swath of ground leading down from a nearby hill range. Old stone ruins—crumbling walls, drunken chimney stacks and the like—dot the woods. The river has a strong current, and those falling in are likely to be swept away.
11. Holy Well: Local legend identifies this crumbling ruin as a holy place. The ruins are extensive and cover over half an acre. This was clearly once a place of high status; at the ruin's centre lies a wide, steep-sided pool of clear, spring water. To whom or what the ruin and well are dedicated is a matter of vigorous local conjecture, but the architectural style suggests an elven origin.
12. Slaughterford: A fortified mill once stood just upstream from this ford, but it burnt down long ago. Slaughterford itself is named for a battle fought a century ago. Hastily dug, now time-worn, defensive earthworks are still evident on both sides of t h e r i v e r a s a r e t h e communal burial cairns of the fallen. 





## WILDLIFE & WOODS 



1. The Bound Oak: Blackened and hollow, the trunk-shard of this massive and ancient oak serves as a way-marker, natural boundary post and meeting place. Local myths place a magic portal to the faerie realm in the tree's hollowed trunk.
2. The Fat Man: This massive yew's bulging trunk is hollow and often serves as a refuge for travellers sheltering from storms, hiding from pursuers and the like. Local lore ages the tree as hundreds of years old.
3. Solalith's Dell: Mosses and ferns give this narrow wooded valley a primitive, primaeval atmosphere. A small stream gurgles forth to birth a small pool all but blocking access to the dell. Only a narrow shelf of rock allows explorers to reach the dell without getting wet.
4. The Old Giants: Bluebells and primroses grow amid this stand of ancient oaks and sweet chestnuts. Sparrowhawks dwell in the vicinity, and several owls lair high up in the trees.
5. Duke's Oak: This ancient, massive oak tree has a girth of over ten meters and is reputed to have been planted by the first duke 500 years ago.
6. Dead Man's Ditch: Named for a bloody border skirmish this muddy, tree-fringed ditch floods after bad weather.
7. The Red Lake: Fringed by red-stone cliffs and gnarled, shallow-rooted beech trees this lake is a well-known camping spot. A low, wooded island peaks above the lake's water. Ducks and swans are commonly seen on the lake and several monstrous pike are thought to dwell in its deeper reaches—certainly no water foul dare the lake's southern stretch.
8. Pluck's Gorge: Named for the legendary parrot companion of the pirate-king Vilimzair Aralivar who was once thought to dwell within, Pluck's Gorge is a deep, enchanting place enclosed by rocky, moist walls festooned with lichens and the like. Within the gorge, stunted trees grow amid a field of moss-wreathed boulders. The place has a tranquil, magical feel.
9. The Three Ugly Giants: Three totem poles—replete with carvings of hideous old men and more horrible creatures—of magically hardened wood watch over this tree-fringed clearing. Set into a large triangle they are centred on a stone block of weathered stone lying at the clearing's exact centre. Legends credit the totems with channelling the land's natural energy into the weathered stone block (that is a portal to the faerie realm).
10. Murky Hollow: This low-lying stretch of woodland is perpetually mud-choked. Locals know to avoid the region's cloying ooze and rapacious stinging insects as little of value or worth lies in this sunken morass. Sometimes outlaws and the like hide on several small islands rising above the muck.
11. The Lych Way: This sunken lane runs arrow-straight through the woods before petering out among tumbled stones surrounding an isolated plunge pool. Local legends—of course—proscribe the Lych Way's origin to the ghostly tread of a lich leading his army to do battle with his arch-rival. The stories tell how every winter solstice the long-slain lich rides forth at the head of his undying host.
12. Coffin Wood: Ages ago, a small church stood at the centre of what is now known as Coffin Wood. The church has long since fallen into disuse, and its stones have been used in the construction of several local buildings. The church's graveyard remains, however, and every now and then the trees' questing roots bring bones and fragments of coffins to the surface. 





# LOOTING THE DEAD 


## LOOTING A DEAD ADVENTURER 



1. A map of the local area and dungeon, apparently drawn by the adventurer. Much of it is stained in blood, but some portions show areas the party has not yet found.
2. A once-fine cloak, maroon coloured with a gold trim, now somewhat torn and worn from age. Careful examination reveals a hidden pocket containing 3 pp and a signet ring with a gold wyvern crest worth 45 gp.
3. Clutched in the slain adventurer's hand is an unopened potion of healing that has a light blue colour and smells faintly of mint when opened. Two empty vials lie in a fine leather satchel at his waist, one of which instead smells of sulphur. Also in the satchel are some dried herbs and other ingredients that, although musty, may produce more potions.
4. A small collection of letters carefully folded and tucked away. The letters are from the adventurer's loved ones and have clearly been read multiple times. The last page is a note meant for whoever finds the fallen adventurer, begging her loved ones are informed of her fate.
5. This pack contains thieves' tools, along with a grappling hook and fifty feet of rope. A supple leather pouch buried at the bottom of the pack holds 10 gp and 7 sp.
6. A map leading to local caches of treasure also shows where the traps protecting them are located. In reality, the opposite is true: the locations marked with traps contain treasure, and the locations marked with treasure contain horrible traps.
7. A string necklace made up of various bits of bone and teeth, presumably trophies from the adventurer's travels. Most are from kobolds, goblins and the like, but the centrepiece tooth appears to be from a young dragon.
8. A compass that appears to be in excellent condition. However, the compass spins wildly at random hampering any attempt at navigation.
9. A metal flask, decorated with engravings of a paladin fighting a dragon, worth 10 gp. Although it is still sealed whatever liquid was inside has gone sour and tastes foul.
10. A tattered journal, written in Dwarven and recording the former owner's travels and experiences. The most recent entries include information about the local area, including known traps, monsters and the fallen adventurer's suspicion about a nearby hidden chamber.
11. The fallen adventurer is at the bottom of a ten-foot. wooden ladder, which can be folded up for easy transportation. It appears the adventurer's neck was broken in a fall.
12. A pickaxe, shovel and crowbar of surprisingly fine craftsmanship but obvious heavy use. The pickaxe is lodged in a nearby wall, marred by several other chips (made by the pickaxe).
13. A small leather pouch full of various items, most of which are shiny to some degree. Most are bits of odd rock or metal, but mixed in among them are 3 sp, 7 cp and a small pearl worth 50 gp.
14. A large sack full of various pieces of clothing, including common peasant clothing, a military uniform, a jester's outfit and fine clothing fit for a minor noble.
15. A holy symbol of a good-aligned deity still hangs around the fallen adventurer's neck. The unfortunate yet clutches the symbol with one hand. While not magical, it is fine enough to be worth 5 gp.
16. A wooden scroll case full of maps of various dungeons. Notes added to the maps suggest the fallen adventurer was visiting the dungeons in some sort of order. Several maps are unmarked, presumably ones yet to have been explored, but the map for this dungeon is missing.
17. A small mirror on the end of a rod used to peer around corners. The fallen adventurer was using it for this purpose when she was attacked from behind. It lies near her outstretched hand.
18. A letter from a local ruler, appears to detail the job the fallen adventurer was pursuing when he died. It includes a detailed description of a jewelled dagger believed lost in the dungeon and details of the 100 gp reward the adventurer would have received for its recovery. The letter concludes with directions to a representative of the ruler in a nearby town who will provide the reward upon receipt of the dagger.
19. A trapmaker's kit, including caltrops and the materials needed to make a series of tripwires, snares and snapjaw traps.
20. A pack containing everything needed to care for weaponry, including whetstones, oil and assorted tools. They seem virtually new; a shattered sword lies near the fallen adventurer's body. 





## LOOTING A DEAD BARD 



1. A care-worn love letter the bearer has read and refolded so many times it is starting to fall apart. The signature at the bottom is smeared and impossible to read. The letter explains the parting of a human—most likely the bard— and their elven lover. The elf believed the relationship was doomed because of the tragically short life span of humans and refused to commit to a short relationship.
2. Ten hexagonal gold coins of unknown origin. They have a hole cut through the centre and are strung together on a thin leather cord. A collector of ancient or exotic coins may offer up to 10 gp per coin.
3. A small vial labelled “Bottled Love” with the instructions “One drop per draught of ale” written in looping script on the side. The smell of the liquid inside is sweet and tempting but quickly overpowering. When administered to someone's drink as per the instructions, the liquid acts as an aphrodisiac.
4. Several pages of sheet music for a haunting melody that sticks in the listener's head if played.
5. A pair of chapbooks, The Wizard's Luck and The Game of Pawns, which feature the love affair and adventures of Shara and Jaxak, a pair of wizards who meet at an arcane academy, fall in love and save the world from the forces of evil.
6. A blue rose that never wilts but is cold to the touch.
7. A travelogue detailing the bard's journey. The badly written stories must be exaggerated, especially the story about the elven queen falling in love with the bard.
8. An ornamental rapier with a silver pommel and silver filigree on the guard. With gold filigree and jewels set in the hilt, the weapon was built for show, not use. Because of the exquisite craftsmanship, the weapon would likely fetch triple the value of a typical rapier.
9. An old rapier that has been used in many battles, but the previous owner took very good care of it. Twisting the pommel reveals a small compartment where one might hide a short document or another small item.
10. A small, slightly worn, silver broach in the shape of a dove with an inscription on the back that reads, “To my dearest, Lorael, on the 400th anniversary of your birth.”
11. A flamboyant, wide-brimmed blue hat with a giant golden eagle's feather stuck in the band.
12. A tiny mimic shaped like an ornate wooden box. The bard had befriended it, and it now plots revenge on those who murdered its friend.
13. A repair kit for the bard's lute including replacement strings and a cloth to clean the instrument.
14. Scraps of paper that when ordered properly become the outline for an epic poem. Based on the outline and the few incomplete verses, this would have been the bard's masterpiece.
15. An annotated copy of The Tragedy of T'Kor, a play about a gnome wizard who summons and falls in love with an incubus. From the notes in the play, the bard was portraying the incubus.
16. A novelty magic trick comprising a simple wooden box with a velvet lining that makes coins disappear when the top is shut and a button depressed.
17. A tiny longsword—no longer than a little finger—made from a magnetic metal.
18. A map of the region with notes beside each town that details the reception the bard received as well as which taverns have the best ale and wine.
19. A quiver of 17 poorly crafted arrows with wicked barbed arrowheads most likely made by goblins or orcs.
20. A golden signet ring bearing the emblem of an ancient elven noble house. The party might be rewarded if they return it (or they might be accused of murder!) 

### OUTLANDISH COSTUMES 



1. A tattered shoulder cape, faded crimson in colour, with frayed edges. Remnants of an unidentifiable, deeper crimson coloured fur run along the hem.
2. A pair of light brown, suede evening gloves with a black braided cord stitched along their entire length.
3. Moderately worn hip boots made of overlapping light grey scales. The outer edges of each boot have daggersized sheaths sewn into both the calf and thigh sections.
4. A yellow tabard, heavily stained and soiled, depicting a large white skeleton key aligned vertically.
5. A black, gothic tailcoat with silver buttons and embroidered with necromantic imagery along the sleeves and hem.
6. A deep blue, high-collared formal shirt. Embroidered nautical imagery in silver thread decorates the collar.
7. An off-white, dire wolf fur shoulder wrap in excellent condition. The fringe is decorated with the wolf's teeth hanging from short leather strips.
8. A thick, charcoal-coloured infinity scarf smelling of wood smoke large enough to envelop the upper body of a human-sized creature. 





## LOOTING A DEAD CLERIC 



1. A necklace of human ears.
2. A purple veil designed to go over the head of a sacrifice.
3. Hemlock, mistletoe and nightshade bound together with a red ribbon.
4. An amulet of the unholy star. In rituals, it is heated until glowing and then placed around a sacrifice's neck.
5. A bag of charcoal made from a church's burnt rafters.
6. A glass vial filled with vinegar containing the severed finger of a fallen saint.
7. Blessed chalk in a variety of lurid colours including red, purple, yellow and red.
8. An incense burner made from a skull covered in silver.
9. White clay prayer beads stained with blood.
10. A bottle of blessed alcohol, spiked with a mild poison.
11. A symbol drawing kit with string, chalk, compasses and a notebook with detailed notes and diagrams.
12. A dozen vials of snake venom.
13. A collection of silver needles designed to prevent the resurrection of a corpse.
14. A preserved dead raven.
15. A broken spyglass with a personalised inscription engraved on the case.
16. A full yellow cloak with large silver clasps and a holy symbol boldly presented in dark green.
17. A brass and copper chainmail shirt with a ring pattern too open and loose to provide actual protection. The mail is worn over a white linen shirt.
18. A bright pink vest covered in tentacle designs.
19. A pair of light green dancing shoes made of silk completed with black laces.
20. A pauldron worn on the right shoulder made of white stained leather. A symbol on it denotes the priest's position in the church's hierarchy. 

### UNHOLY SYMBOLS 



1. This unholy symbol has a secret compartment; it contains a single platinum piece wrapped in scraps of cloth so that it does not rattle.
2. This unholy symbol has a secret compartment; it contains scraps of bone and hair—remnants of a great hero of the faith. The owner believed they imbue the symbol with extra power.
3. This steel unholy symbol has one particularly sharp edge; close examination reveals dried blood smeared over the metal edge.
4. This holy symbol has several spikes. Close examination reveals a hidden compartment inside designed to hold poison which affects anyone stabbed or cut with the spikes. The compartment can hold two doses of poison.
5. This unholy symbol appears to be of solid silver; however, it is too light to be solid silver; it is actually wood covered in silver paint and is essentially worthless.
6. This unholy symbol is very old; the finer details have been worn smooth by time and use, and the symbol is in poor repair.
7. This large, heavy symbol is made of some kind of dense, dark grey metal; it resists damage but has a long crack down one edge. The symbol was the phylactery of a powerful lich in the service of the same dark power; if it was to be repaired, the lich might return to unlife.
8. This metal unholy symbol comprises the melted down remains of several holy symbols; some of their details yet remain. Observant characters make out different good-aligned defaced symbols on its surface.
9. Large and unwieldy, this unholy symbol is sized for a giant. Clips allow the symbol to be “opened” and the whole to be worn as a necklace (or collar).
10. This unholy symbol hangs from a particularly long chain that allows it to be worn at navel height. Some of the chain's links are particularly worn. 



### UNHOLY WATER VIALS 



1. Crafted from human skin, this flask is soft and pliable to the touch—perhaps disturbingly so.
2. Forged of iron, and decorated with an unholy symbol of evil, this flask always seems slightly warm to the touch. When it is full, the unholy water within roils about as if it is about to come to boil.
3. This leather flask is rigid and has been decorated with faded tattoos depicting acts of great evil and perversity.
4. Painted jet black, this flask is unsettling to look at. To the casual observer, some parts of the flask are darker than others and lazy or paranoid observers may fancy the darker patches are slightly mobile.
5. This simple fired clay pot has a bone stopper carved from the finger bone of some human-sized unfortunate.
6. This long and slender flask has a wickedly pointed stopper, which could be used as an improvised dagger in extremis. 





## LOOTING A DEAD THIEF 



1. A small, soft black pouch containing a half-dozen lock picks. One is horribly bent and all but useless.
2. A heavy, well-worn leather sap. Some of its stitching is frayed. Perceptive characters notice the sap is heavier than it should be. Further investigations uncover 5 pp hidden within.
3. The rogue's belt has a hidden compartment sewn into the lining. It holds three lock picks, one gold coin, one platinum coin and a small knife made for a creature two sizes smaller than the thief.
4. Hidden in each of the thief's boots lurks a slender dagger. The two are a pair and if sold together fetch triple the normal amount.
5. The thief wore an oversized earring in his left ear. At first glance, it is a piece of cheap, brass costume jewellery. However, cunningly hidden within is a secret compartment that holds a potion that turns the imbiber to gas.
6. The thief wears a black cloak with a voluminous hood. Strangely, the cloak has a belt so it can be pulled tight around the wearer's waist. Each of the arm's cuffs has small pockets sized perfectly for a potion (or poison) vial.
7. A disorganised jumble of jewellery fills one pouch. Sadly, most of it is costume jewellery and virtually worthless. However, a perceptive searcher finds one plain gold ring sized for a fat finger worth 50 gp.
8. A small half-sized flask of oil wrapped in an oil-stained rag. Also present is a very small brush sized for fitting into locks and other hard-to-reach places.
9. A red hood with holes for two eyeholes and a mouth.
10. The thief's boots each have a hidden compartment in their heel. The compartments are large enough to hold several coins or similarly sized objects. One holds three platinum coins while the other has a coiled up lock pick.
11. One of the thief's pouches holds nothing but a neatly folded hemp sack. The sack, however, has several different internal compartments making it much easier to organise one's loot.
12. The thief has a well-equipped thieves' kit. They also owned a small pry bar sized perfectly for coffers, desk draws and so on. The pry bar makes opening such compartments slightly easier.
13. A small bag of finely ground flour tied shut with a length of yellow twine. If thrown or scattered, the flour can cover a five-foot-square area.
14. The thief's dagger has a hollow hilt accessed by unscrewing its bulbous pommel. Hidden inside are two lock picks and a scrap of ragged cloth.
15. A tarnished copper signal whistle hangs around the thief's neck on a leather thong. The whistle's mouthpiece is shaped liked a pair of pouting lips.
16. The thief's cloak is double lined. The outside is black while the inside is a gaudy gold colour. The cloak can be worn either way round.
17. The thief's pouches are seemingly normal, but they have small loops sewn inside them making it easier to store gear (and to get at that gear in a hurry). Two such pouches carry a very well organised thieves' tool kit.
18. A wineskin filled with cheap wine (used by the thief as a distraction or bribe). The wine has been doctored with sleep poison.
19. This reinforced pouch contains nothing but sharp shards of pottery. If scattered, they act as caltrops and fill a tenfoot- square area.
20. A well-made wig with long, black hair and several pieces of fake jewellery fill this pouch. 





## LOOTING A DEAD WARRIOR 



1. A partially carved piece of wood that might represent a small dog…or it might not; the carving is so bad, it's hard to tell.
2. Three worn and bent silver coins of obviously ancient origin. The details on the coins' faces cannot be made out, but one has a small chip missing.
3. Two brass keys tied together with a short length of fraying blue twine.
4. A blood-stained cloth along with a tightly wound bandage and a half-empty flask of oil.
5. A small wooden box containing a fine white powder— snuff—that smells strongly of cinnamon.
6. A list of names on a scrap of parchment. Only the last two have not had a line drawn through them.
7. A well-worn flint and steel along with some scraps of dried and frayed cloth all bundled together in a small, waterproof pouch.
8. A handful of dried meat and an all but empty tiny clay pot of honey.
9. An empty bone scroll tube missing both its stoppers. The bone is yellowed and obviously old.
10. A tarnished and broken golden chain missing several links. Several of the links are very worn and the whole thing is worth no more than 10 gp—as scrap metal.
11. A small, mud-stained book. Its pages are in better condition, although not well written or illustrated. The work is an overview of a nearby kingdom and details major settlements and geographical features.
12. Several long hopelessly tangled pieces of string.
13. A dozen gold coins (seemingly). In reality, these heavy coins are lead and have been covered with a golden wash. The job is good enough to stand a cursory glance.
14. A whetstone, an oily rag and a small flask of oil all contained within a stained, slightly smelly belt pouch.
15. A scrap of parchment with the message, “Midnight on the Street of Smoke”.
16. A scrap of parchment depicting a crude treasure map. Named features include “Big Tree”, “Pond”, and “Bone Pile”. However, there are no features of the wider area to enable anyone to follow the map (or details of the hidden treasure).
17. Several sheaves of parchment depict scantily clad elven men in odd poses—the pictures are surprisingly detailed.
18. A golden ring—perhaps a wedding band. The engraving inside spells out “Beloved” in Dwarven runes. The ring is worth 50 gp.
19. A pouch containing several bunches of dried herbs. Each bunch is tied with a different colour twine.
20. Several small chunks of local rock. Each chunk has flecks of gold embedded within that glimmers in the light—a tantalising clue (perhaps) to a nearby as yet undiscovered deposit of gold. 





## LOOTING A DEAD WIZARD 



1. An amulet comprising a single, yellowed dragon's tooth suspended from a leather thong. A rune for protection is carved into the tooth.
2. A small flask of powered silver (worth 50 gp). The leather flask has a thin leather strap allowing it to be carried over the shoulder.
3. A silver dagger concealed is concealed in one of the wizard's boots. The weapon is clearly unused—its blade is sharp and polished to a high sheen.
4. A silver bracelet from which hang a number of charms. Each is decorated with a single rune—fire, water, air, earth, dragon, devil, demon—among them. The whole thing is worth 75 gp.
5. A leather scroll tube crudely painted bright blue. It is stoppered with a leather bung that clips into the place. The bung has been painted red.
6. These fine leather boots have four small, unobtrusive pockets hidden inside. Most of the pockets hold commonly available spell components, but two hold a single platinum coin.
7. This plain scroll tube contains several pieces of parchment the wizard used to make observations of the stars. These comprise several complicated diagrams of various constellations and cryptic notes regarding “the wanderer."
8. The torn and scorched cover of Agananzar's Workbook is wrapped in cloth and hidden in the wizard's pack. Sadly, nothing else of the book's contents remains.
9. A pouch contains a variety of small bones—probably finger bones—clearly “harvested” from a variety of different creatures. Each is in pristine condition—all the skin having been boiled away.
10. Three empty potion vials; one is marked “invisibility” while the other two smell slightly of cinnamon.
11. A locket holding a lock of coarse black hair. It is evident from the hair's texture—and the slight smell of rotten eggs—the hair is not from a natural source.
12. A dozen small semi-circular stones are worn perfectly smooth. An esoteric rune—depicting various types of magic—adorns each stone.
13. A slender belt pouch specially treated to be waterproof. Inside the pouch, the wizard stored a variety of dried herbs. Each bunch is tied together with twine.
14. The shattered stub of a wooden stake. Black blood covers the stake's tip. Barely visible under the blood is some kind of rune, but its meaning is impossible to determine as part of it is missing.
15. Three quills wrapped in an ink-stained cloth and two small vials of ink—red and black—all carried in a small pouch along with several scraps of crumpled parchment.
16. A bent iron spike, the head of a hammer and a shard of incredibly tough stone.
17. A black velvet cloth inlaid with golden thread wrapped around a dried and perfectly preserved red rose. The rose's thorns are yet sharp and its flower emits a particular heady scent.
18. A small treatise depicting the various protective circles— against good, evil and so on—along with notes on how to quickly create such protective barriers. A perceptive reader skilled in the arcane arts may note that several of the diagrams are fatally flawed.
19. A flask of holy water and a flask of unholy water—both clearly labelled in Elven—along with a fine painter's brush, two owlbear feathers and one gigantic feather (perhaps from a roc or other colossal bird).
20. A small red velvet pouch. The pouch is all but empty— however, a determined examination reveals a few flecks of diamond dust stuck to the pouch's lining. 


### REMARKABLE SPELLBOOKS 



1. The Abominable Encyclopaedia: This book's title is embossed on the wyvern hide cover, which is also marred by several minor burn marks. The book's parchment pages have gold-gilded edges.
2. Codex Eternal: Double the length of a normal book, the codex is in terrible condition. Its purple-worm hide cover is worn and tattered and many of its pages—vellum seemingly crafted from stirge wings—are loose. The cover is scratched as if some huge creature had drawn its claw across the book.
3. Rascorim's Workbook: A plain, unassuming book, Raxorim's Workbook's cover is unadorned. Its thin pages smell faintly of chemicals and other unknowable odours. As well as his spells, Rascorim used the book to record his various alchemical experiments. Such notes begin on the last page and work backwards through the book.
4. Cosmic Musings: As well as serving as a spellbook, this weighty tome deals with the planes and their denizens. Intricate geometric patterns adorn the cover and a clasp of silver holds the whole thing closed.
5. Compendium Arcane: Decorated with a single silverembossed pentagram on its cover, each page of this book is embossed with the ancient elven symbol denoting magic.
6. Unnamed: This book is missing part of its front cover and half of its pages have been partially ripped from its spine. The pages—ink faded and water damaged—are barely legible. 








# LUNATIC ASYLUM 


## 20 PIECES OF DRESSING 

1. Colourful, child-like writing decorates a nearby wall, recently drawn in chalk. The words are rambling and nonsensical, but some are underlined, and perhaps contain a hidden message.
2. An elaborately carved wooden chess set sits on a small table. Several moves have been made, and a character with knowledge of the game might recognise the opening as Ekko's Charge, a much-derided opening that only a novice or savant would use.
3. A small piece of linen is hidden behind a potted shrub. The linen protects a tiny packet of worn paper, within which is a white, powdery substance that crumbles easily when touched.
4. A heavy table is covered by a large linen tablecloth that sits askew across it, Hidden beneath the table are several bowls, roughly stacked. Soup, white and fluffy with mould, remains in many of them.
5. Small exotic plants grow out of simple pots, their scent leaving the area stinking of rotten flesh. The air is thick with flies, which occasionally land in one of the long, sticky flowers, from which there is no escape.
6. This window has thick iron bars inset. Closer inspection reveals severe corrosion around the base of the bars, and a rotting substance that smells of burnt tomatoes lies thick around the bottom of the window.
7. Glassware in various shapes and sizes fills the tabletops. The many jars carefully stored contain a variety of substances and powders. A handwritten note pinned to the wall details a recipe for a sleeping powder designed to be burnt in a censor.
8. A crude mouth forms in a nearby wall. It introduces itself as Eni, the assistant, in a mono-tonal voice. Eni is apparently very happy to provide answers to any questions, but often seems to misunderstand the context of those questions.
9. Paintings of what might be previous members of staff decorate the walls. The wooden signs displayed their names have been deeply scratched, obliterating anything legible. The faces are extraordinarily lifelike, giving the impression that their eyes follow visitors around the room.
10. The bed set against the wall is immaculately made; its clean white sheets look pressed and unused, but an impressively large pile of torn and bloody toenails next to the pillow suggests someone does sleep here.
11. The clean, cream walls here are suggestive of a medical area. A padded chair stands in the centre of the area, complete with leather restraint, and a collection of medical tools lies on top of a table adjacent to the chair.
12. The many long tables and cooking pots indicate this is a mess hall. Partially hidden in the pocket of a hanging apron is an empty bottle, labelled “To treat constipation”.
13. This room is well lit, and various chairs are placed about it. A well-stocked bookshelf gathers dust in one corner. A closer examination shows the shelf only contains three different titles; the remainder are duplicates.
14. An unadorned censor sits on a small podium in the centre of this communal area. It releases a drug-laced cloud at regular intervals, leaving anyone nearby feeling lethargic for a time. Several convenient divans offer themselves for use.
15. This fun, brightly decorated area features many simple toys and puzzles. A pictograph on one wall shows a child receiving a warning for some indiscretion; a second picture shows a tooth being removed by tongs.
16. Many mirrors hang on the walls, while oddly textured and coloured toys are held in boxes, many of which also make odd sounds when played with. The lighting smoothly changes into different colours at regular intervals; in time with this, nozzles in the ceiling release a variety of sweet scents into the air.
17. The shelves of this extensive library bow under the weight of their tomes. Close examination of the books shows they all detail mental illnesses, magical or otherwise, and how to treat them.
18. A sturdy chair sporting worn leather restraints has an odd metal bowl positioned above it. A twisted copper wire leads from a gauntlet to the bowl, and a bucket sits by the base of the chair; the bucket holds a sponge and a thick wooden dowel replete with many teeth marks.
19. The scent of many beautiful flowers exudes from this indoor garden. Plants spill out of their ceramic pots, leaving the area feeling messy and overgrown. Movement from within the foliage suggests some thing ha s t a ke n up residence within.
20. Pitiful mewling and whining emanates from the inhabitants in the many cages lining these walls. The c r amp e d b a r s contain a large number of cats and dogs, some o f wh i c h a r e tragically silent. 





## 20 MINOR EVENTS



1. A feminine voice shouts from a nearby room. The phrases are random, made up from several different l anguages . The voi c e qui c k l y bui lds t o a n incomprehensible scream, before falling silent. A woman can be found nearby, sleeping peacefully in a cot.
2. A slender half-naked man stands facing a corner, repeatedly reciting a religious passage from a book he holds in hands while his whole body shakes. Crudely tattooed into his back is the word “PENITENT”.
3. Two men stand over a young woman, who is gagged and strapped to a bench, She twitches spasmodically, unable to move as the men calmly use a hand drill to bore into her skull. They seem pleased with their work.
4. Dozens of bloated leeches hang from the man lying here, while one apothecary explains to another how this technique removes the infected blood causing the patient's insanity.
5. A shadow stalks through the area, its shape reminiscent of something half-remembered in nightmares. Although exuding fear so palpable that most seeing it begin to sweat, the shadow cannot be interacted with, and disappears through a wall.
6. A scratching, scurrying sound comes from nearby. It approaches quickly, and a foot-long rat comes into view, dragging a bloody arm. The rat immediately drops the arm and runs into a small hole in a wall. A cursory examination shows the arm has been sawn off.
7. This small chamber has a shallowly sloped floor leading to a drain. A chain hangs from above; if pulled, a thin stream of near freezing water pours from the ceiling. A shelf holds a slender piece of soap, and a poorly-hidden peep hole are the only other features visible.
8. A flash of light gives way to a humanoid, gasping and shivering in a foetal position on the floor. They wear illfitting white overalls with the word “INMATE" in red lettering on their back. A name is written in neat black letters on a small card stuck to a breast pocket.
9. Three well-dressed women take turns staring through a small window, laughing at whatever they see beyond. The alienist accompanying them explains the patient within will be beaten until they acquire the mental strength to cast out the other beings infesting their body. This is judged to be a very effective treatment.
10. Blood pools on the floor below a man limply suspended by chains from the ceiling. Another man holding a bloody hammer cowers back as he explains he was only letting the bad humours out.
11. A rough-looking inmate brushes passed, turning after a moment. His intimidating glare is at odds with his beautiful voice as he elegantly recites a poem in an unknown language. The words cannot be understood, but the tone is that of threat and danger.
12. An inmate crawls across the floor, his body covered with sores and partially healed wounds. His legs, trailing uselessly behind, are mottled green and black, and putrefaction's stench fills the air. He props himself up against a wall and proffers a rusty saw, silently begging for help.
13. Two doors lead into this dark bedroom. The sheets are dirty and soiled, but it is the manacled and tortured body attached to the bed that draws the eye. A rack on the opposite wall contains a variety of implements designed to cause lasting pain. Against all odds, a groan issues from the body.
14. Shivering violently, the person sitting in this icy bath is tied, gagged, and wears little else. They are blue with the cold. An alienist watches, marking time with a sand timer. Less than half the sand has fallen.
15. A priest wearing yellow robes intones powerfully, presenting their holy symbol to a horned, red-skinned teenager restrained in a bed. The child screams and begs in horror, protesting their innocence. The symbol is metallic and glows red-hot.
16. Two men circle each other, joined by a thick chain attached to the collars around their necks. A woman stands nearby, making notes as they strike each other. At each blow, a cheer sounds from an unseen audience.
17. A groaning figure sits on a sturdy chair, which in turn is suspended by a rope. The chair is spinning quickly, controlled by someone dressed as an alienist. Splatters of vomit cover the floor.
18. An adorable puppy wanders up, rubbing itself against any available legs. It happily follows anyone showing it affection or feeding it, and remains with the character for as long as it is treated well.
19. A hugely obese man is trapped inside a barrel-like contraption, his mouth held open by a cruel funnel. Another man, dressed in stained white clothes, is slowly pouring soup into the funnel. A scroll, held open by a pair of empty bowls, has the title "Kuring Glvttonie".
20. Thick windows reveal the next room, where a man sits struggling to free himself from a metal chair, water dripping down from a soaking pad upon his head. A neatly dressed woman stands behind him, and presses a metal gauntlet down on the seated man's head; the man screams through gritted teeth while convulsing. The woman removes her hand after a few moments and is clearly preparing to repeat the process. 





## THE INSANE 



1. ALBERICH STONESHIELD This golden-skinned dwarf has a long, salt-and-pepper beard. Splotches of grey paint cover his once white overalls. Alberich Stoneshield (LG male dwarf) paints the walls of his room with prescient images of future events. Personality: Alberich speaks distractedly, slurring his words and changing the subject frequently. He is interested in shiny things, but only momentarily. Mannerisms: The dwarf refuses to look directly into anyone's eyes, preferring to focus on bright and shiny objects. Alberich wanders off when the mood takes him, even in mid-conversation. Hook: Every evening, after lights out, Alberich begins to paint on his room's walls. These abstract pictures, painted only in shades of grey, are said to predict the near future but are cleaned off by staff regularly. The latest painting appears to show the party, hurt and captured; does the painting hold clues showing how to avoid their fate?
2. AUNI LEMPIVALKO Short greying hair sits atop a face with sunken cheeks pocked with sores. The woman's skin has an unhealthy, yellowish cast. Auni Lempivalko (CN female human) believes everything is a negotiation. Personality: Auni is friendly, conniving, aggressive, or pleading in pursuit of the drugs she craves. Once she has a supply, she relaxes and is generally friendly unless her stash is threatened. Mannerisms: Auni often hugs herself when suffering from muscle cramps and nausea when too long without her drugs; this progresses to tremors and vomiting within a short time. She becomes more desperate—and eventually violent— as her symptoms worsen. Hook: Once a valued member of staff, Auni witnessed too many horrors and too much suffering. She began taking the drugs she used to feed the inmates, quickly becoming addicted. Unable to free herself from their grip, she has become an inmate herself. Auni happily shares her intimate knowledge of the asylum with anyone procuring her some drugs.
3. DURRA BIGIT This orc stands head and shoulders above almost anyone, her massive thews evidence of epic strength. A particularly nasty scar stretches over her exposed scalp. Durra Bigit (CG female orc fighter 3) wanders the halls looking for small things to steal. Personality: Durra has become accustomed to her situation and doesn't complain. Instead, she comes across as someone entirely happy with the relative safety her current accommodation provide. Mannerisms: Durra is forever tapping her hands on her knees or other surfaces, trying to keep her kleptomania at bay, something she has struggled with since sustaining a head wound while fighting a demon. Hook: The huge orc bumps into a character as she tries to ease her bulk passed. She apologises and moves on, just as the character she bumped into becomes aware their coin purse is missing.
4. FREDRIK TURNIO This swarthy, older man seems to be trying to look in every direction at once. The deep bags under his eyes reveal a chronic lack of sleep. Stubble sits heavy on his cheeks, and he sweats nervously. Fredrik Turnio (CN male human) retreats from any threat or confrontation. Personality: Fredrik is frightened of everyone and is unwilling to assist or offer any information to strangers. His fear consumes him and leaves him appearing defensive, secretive and standoffish. Mannerisms: Fredrik's eyes dart about, looking for threats. His hands sweep through his long grey hair. If cornered, he reacts aggressively. Hook: Years ago, Fredrik was highly placed within a large thieves' guild before betraying them. He believes they have sent assassins after him, but is this just his paranoia talking?
5. INKERI PUUKKO This young, willow-thin lady wears an inmate's ubiquitous white overalls but leaves her feet bare. She wears a small, lavender-filled pouch around her neck, and tired-looking flowers are braided into bands about her wrists. Inkeri Puukko (N female human) believes nature has the solution to all ailments afflicting humans and their ilk. Personality: Inkeri is outgoing, friendly and happy to share what she knows. She comes across as a bright ray of sunshine in an otherwise dark place. Mannerisms: Inkeri believes in the inherent powers of plants; she feels they can cure most ills if used correctly. She talks to her plants frequently, asking for forgiveness before harvesting them. Hook: The young woman claims to “sense” an illness within one of the party and offers to brew a tisane to cure them. Others in the asylum know she is here due to having forced her sister to drink a brew made from nightshade, with fatal consequences; can she be trusted not to repeat this “accidental” tragedy? 
6. KAARLE UNTO This man's face is badly mutilated; runes have been alternately branded, carved or tattooed into his skin, leaving little clue as to his original appearance. Striking amethyst eyes stare vacantly above a nose with multiple piercings. Black metallic gauntlets are locked around his hands. Kaarle Unto (CE male human cleric 2) pleads for notice and approval from his dark patron—a patron who has driven him mad. Personality: Utterly insane, with only occasional moments of lucidity, Kaarle rambles and jibbers, talking about much and nothing. Mannerisms: When lucid, Kaarle sucks his thumb, bows his head, and can be heard praying for forgiveness for an unknown crime. In the depths of madness Kaarle instead begs for the power to free himself, looking up to the heavens as he does. Hook: Kaarle's pursuit of power led him to a patron not of this reality, which consumed much of his mind and led him to commit incredibly evil acts. Some still seek revenge for his atrocities.
7. KALERVO MAANAVILJE This young boy can be no more than seven or eight years old; tight blonde curls frame a cherubic face with a ready grin and a cheeky sparkle in his green eyes. He reaches out as if seeking a cuddle, revealing unusually long fingernails. Kalervo Maanavilje (CG young male human) plays practical jokes on his fellows while a demon lurking within slowly grows in power. Personality: As cheeky as he looks, Kalervo changes his mood on a whim. One moment he's enjoying a hug, and the next, he is crying. With little warning, he becomes aggressive and screams and shouts in a fiendish tongue. Mannerisms: Kelervo delights in playing small practical jokes, alternately delighting and frustrating those about him. He resents being given orders, which can cause him to scratch and bite. Hook: A fiend possesses the boy, growing in power and control as Kalervo ages. This possession was mistaken for insanity, and he was committed to an asylum as a toddler. A powerful priest is required to save the boy.
8. SHANNA EKKO ILLDACER This elven maiden possesses almost unearthly beauty. Long auburn tresses flow over her shoulders. A tattoo of a set of scales on her left cheek seems out of place. Shanna Ekko Illdacer (LE female elf cleric 3) prays for guidance and justice. Personality: Pleasant, if overly serious, Shanna seems friendly enough at first. However, she becomes intensely focused if she finds any sign of injustice. Mannerisms: Frequently rubs a tattoo of her god's symbol just below her neck whilst intoning a prayer—a request for help with finding injustice in the world. Hook: Shanna has been told an unrepentant killer hides in the asylum. She seeks this murderer, looking for any clue as to their identity. She gently questions any newcomers for information, oblivious that she herself is the killer she seeks. 





## THE STAFF 



1. ARLA IAWSON This unusually tall woman wears her long ginger hair in a bun. Several vials and packets of herbs fill the pockets of her long white coat. Arla Lawson (LN female human) speaks in the same way she work—in a measured, careful fashion. Personality: Arla is polite and respectful, but firm, as befitting her position as an apothecary. She is selfdisciplined, and aware her predecessor lost himself to the soothing properties of the potions he brewed. Mannerisms: Arla's movements are deliberate and precise; she rarely rushes anything. She makes notes whenever she dispenses any treatment to a patient. Hook: Her main responsibilities are to ensure the inmates are given their medications each day. Arla believes one of the inmates is somehow stashing their sedatives, and would appreciate any assistance with finding this cache.
2. ELIZA FARINGRAY This solidly built woman wears a dark blue cloak over a solemn grey tunic. Younger than she first appears, she radiates confidence. Eliza Faringray (LN female human fighter 1) patrols the halls, but worries about what she might find. Personality: Although she hides it well, Eliza is far less sure of herself than it first appears. She hides this and tries to be as professional as possible. Mannerisms: Eliza taps her club, or even strokes it, as if finding reassurance from its presence. Hook: Eliza has been receiving anonymous threatening notes, presumably from one of the inmates. She would welcome help finding and punishing the culprit.
3. HELMUT TEMPLE A yellowish translucent figure emerges from a solid wall; the figure is that of an elderly human male, with small, round spectacles balanced upon his sizeable nose. Helmut Temple (LN male human ghost) once worked here— and hasn't yet realised he is dead. Personality: Unfailingly polite and calm, Helmut gently probes for more information about an individual, seeking to make a diagnosis and offer a treatment. Mannerisms: Helmut keeps pushing his spectacles up his nose, and takes notes on a sheaf of parchment. Hook: Helmut would love to dig deeper into the history of one of the characters, giving them an opportunity to resolve an event in their past. He's got all the time in world, to help—there is no rush.
4. OSTON TALLTENDER Short even by the standards of his race, this halfling wears an unwashed apron over equally unclean clothes. His spiked blonde hair is obviously (and badly) dyed. Oston Talltender (CN male halfling) cooks for the staff and inmates. He's not big on personal hygiene. Personality: Oston never seems to have enough time; every interruption is an inconvenience, and he resents that, leaving him grumpy and unhelpful. Mannerisms: Oston rarely stops to give anyone the time of day, either hurrying on to his destination or industriously going about his work. Hook: Feeling his skills deserve a better audience, Oston occasionally steals a powerful laxative to add to his soups to amuse himself. Some of the staff have their suspicions about his cooking.
5. RANDALL DAWNFOWL Moving stiffly, this old man is completely bald. The thick stubble on his cheeks is white, almost hiding how gaunt his face is. His grey overalls seem too large for his frame. Randall Dawnfowl (LG male human) sweeps and cleans— some would say incessantly. Personality: Randall is a kind fellow, very charitable, but is always tired, and is well past the point he should be working. He displays a wry, self-deprecating humour when drawn into conversation. Mannerisms: Randall moves slowly, often holding his back as he moves, as if in pain. He also sometimes cups his ear with his hand, as his hearing isn't as good as it once was. Hook: Randall's is a sad story. His wife died several years ago, and now his daughter lies at home, being consumed by an awful disease; Randall is working to earn enough gold to pay a cleric for a healing; he is desperate enough that he would consider almost any way to earn more coin.
6. SARA SWILLER This middle-aged lady has greying hair and a friendly smile, and an odd blackish patch on her lips. She wears a knitted pink shawl over her shoulders. Sara Swiller (LN female human) mothers anyone and everyone at the asylum Personality: Sarah is a talkative, mothering type, who loves to indulge in a friendly gossip. She likes to feel needed, and responds well if favours are asked of her. Mannerisms: Sara is clumsy, and often drops the scrolls she carries about. She also often sucks on her quill, leaving a large ink spot on her lips; this is a long-standing habit, and she keeps a handkerchief in her pocket to clean up. Hook: One of Sara's important scrolls carries is missing, and she needs to find it before the other staff become aware of its loss. 





# MERCHANT CARAVAN 



## NOTABLE MERCHANTS 



1. AATU PÄIVÖ Wearing once fine, but now worn, robes this thin, brownhaired potbellied man has an air of nervous energy—or perhaps desperation—about him. Aatu Päivö (CN male human fighter 2) sinks deeper into debt with each passing month—and he's growing desperate. Easily seduced by a good bargain, he has made some questionable investments and borrowed heavily to fund those investments. Those loans are now due—and he has no way of paying them. Personality: Aatu is charismatic and persuasive, but supremely unorganised. His attention to detail is sporadic at best, and he is fond of a drink or two. Mannerisms: Perpetually thirsty, Aatu often licks his lips in anticipation of his next drink. He vigorously shakes hands with everyone he meets. Hooks: Aatu needs money, and the characters likely have enough for his needs. He becomes their best friend in his quest to gain what he needs. He offers to sell them literally anything—he just needs a retainer for expenses—or offers them a part of his “thriving” business if they should make a “modest” investment.
2. FILPPU LEMMÄS Handsome, slender and dark-haired this half-elven man wears fine, spotless clothes. His eyes are alive with intelligence—and hard calculation. Filppu Lemmäs (LE male half-elf thief 3) sees everyone as a resource to be discarded when they are of no more use. Personality: Cold, calculating and with little empathy Filppu sees all personal interactions as transactions—and he has no intention of being shortchanged. He loves only money—and the comforts it can buy (for him). Filppu stays within the bounds and strictures of the law—he can't be bothered with legal entanglements. Mannerisms: Filppu has a way of looking folk up and down—essentially of measuring their worth (and value to him) —that can be quite discomforting for a nervous person. Hooks: Filppu has decided the characters could be good customers and seeks to learn all he can about him. His questions are invasive, but if the characters can put up with them Filppu might have “just the thing” for them.
3. ILMA ILMARINEN Deep black rings hang under this dishevelled woman's eyes. Ilma Ilmarinen (LN female human fighter 2) embraces misery and negativity. Life has not been kind to Ilma, and her physical and mental health have suffered as a result. Personality: Ilma is despondent and assumes most things will turn out for the worst. She soldiers on, for her young son, Jaakko. She is a devout follower of Conn (LN greater god of community, family and rulership), but continued bad luck is testing her faith to the utmost. Mannerisms: Deep sighs punctuate Ilma's conversation, and she often lapses into a monotone voice. Hooks: Ilma isn't unlucky or cursed—she is being terrorised by a bored, mischievous imp who has decided to ruin her life. The imp uses its powers and cunning to turn every situation to Ilma's disadvantage.
4. RAUNA ANTERO Clad in fine furs and a floor-length bright blue robe this woman has an air of culture and sophistication. Her hair is immaculate and her gaze confident. Rauna Antero (N female human wizard 3) deals exclusively in portable, valuable items for select clients. (For “select clients” Rauna means anyone who can pay). Personality: Rauna is discrete, intelligent and used to the fine things in life. She hates travelling, and only does does so for pressing need or high profit. Mannerisms: Rauna considers her words carefully and speaks slowly, but with great certainty. She favours the use of dramatic pauses in her speech. Hooks: Rauna decides one of the characters is wealthy, and really, really needs that which she has for sale. 





## NOTABLE GUARDS & SERVANTS 



1. JUHO MIELA Wearing nondescript clothes this thin man has a pale countenance and eyes that dart about. He wears his muddy blonde hair up in a pigtail. Juho Miela (N male human thief 2) harbours no desire to steal from the caravan. Rather he wants to get as far away from the last town as possible. A consummate actor, Juho has wholly thrown himself into the role of servant. He plans to disappear when the caravan next arrives at a sufficiently large town or city. Personality: Hard work does not scare Juho—particularly if the alternative is imprisonment or mutilation. He doesn't like the countryside—it is too green and the smells are odd. Mannerisms: Juho's eyes dart about, never staying still for long. Perceptive characters note he also sometimes rolls his right shoulder as if trying to work a strained muscle. Hooks: Juho is wanted for a brutal burglary in which a man was killed. Juho is innocent of the crime—a rival set him up—but he knows he won't get a fair trial if caught. Perceptive characters notice Juho is unduly nervous. Investigations reveals incriminating items in his possession including several daggers, a comprehensive set of thieves' tools and a small store of gold.
2. MARTTA RASANTAJA This chain-clad woman has a kindly face and an impressively muscular physique. She wears her black hair cut short. Martta Rasantaja (LG female human fighter 1) dreams of taking holy vows, and joining a famous knightly order. Guarding this caravan and its folk is merely a means to a end for her: experience. Personality: Kind, brave and empathetic Martta would make a fine paladin, if she could secure the requisite training. She believes in chivalry, mercy and chastity along with humankind's intrinsic goodness. Some say this makes her naive; others that she is destined for great things. Mannerisms: Martta speaks in an archaic style she learnt from old story books. Hooks: Martta attaches herself to any paladins or lawful good clerics in the group and tries to ingratiate herself with them. She offers herself as a squire—in the hopes of starting her career as a famous knight.
3. RIILKA OVERHILL Barely three-foot-tall this halfling woman wears travel-stained leather armour and carries a shortbow casually slung over one shoulder. Riilka Overhill (NG female halfling thief 5) works as a scout and travels ahead of the caravan on a swift, surefooted mountain pony. She returns only at night or to warn of impending danger. Personality: Riilka is honest, friendly and trustworthy. At home in the wilderness, she is supremely knowledgeable in the ways of the wild and nature. She loves her pony—it is more of a companion than a mount to her. Mannerisms: Riilka has a potentially comical highpitched voice about which unkind folk may joke. Such folk find themselves the victim of various minor, irritating accidents such as missing boots, ruined rations and so on. Hooks: At dusk, Riilka has not returned to camp. The merchant asks the characters to search for her.
4. YARG YARGSON An impressive, but greying, moustache frames this middleaged man's face. Despite his age, he moves with the fluid grace of a much younger person. Yarg Yargson (LG middle-aged male human fighter 5) knows he is not as young as he once was and craves retirement—or at the least a cushy job which does not require any travel or serious danger. Personality: Yarg has no real sense of humour. Almost three decades of selling his sword to the highest bidder has flogged the lust for adventure and excitement from his mind. Now, he favours relaxing by a fire drinking fine wine. Mannerisms: Yarg incessantly grooms and combs his impressive moustache—it is his pride and joy, and something of a family tradition. He does not deal well with derogatory remarks regarding its appearance. Hooks: Yarg may seem like a coward—he doesn't exactly rush to confront danger—but he is far from it. A suggestion of cowardice on his part immediately draw his ire. He will not forget any stain on his honour. 





## NOTABLE GOODS 



1. Bearskin (30 gp): This thick, lush black bearskin came from a creature over ten-foot tall. The skin could be fashioned into a cloak for anyone smaller than a giant!
2. Barrel of Oil (10 gp): This small and stout well-sealed barrel holds 80 pints of lamp oil. It is heavy—100 lbs.—but just the thing for adventurers fighting trolls or who just need (or want) to set fire to something else.
3. Spyglass (1,000 gp): Stored carefully in a straw-filled coffer secured with a heavy padlock this bronze spyglass is a work of art. Ornate scrollwork depicting shooting stars, constellations and the like decorate its length.
4. Infant Owlbear (3,000 gp): A stout iron-barred cage holds an infant owlbear. The creature hoots and screeches, and swipes at anyone getting too close to its cage. Paranoid characters may fear the creature's screeching and hooting could bring other predators down upon the caravan—and they might be right.
5. Hippogriff Egg (1,000 gp): A stout iron-banded locked chest hides under a great pile of blankets. Straw fills the box, and nestled deeply within lies a large mottled white and grey egg. This is a fabulously rare hippogriff egg. It will hatch in three weeks.
6. Marble (2,000 gp): This slightly larger than man-sized chunk of high quality marble is destined for a famous sculptor's workshop. The stone is pure white and glimmers slightly in the light. It is of good enough quality to serve in the creation of some kind of animate statue guardian.
7. Arms & Armour (various prices): Carefully crated and stored arms and armour fill a wagon. The merchant is transporting 30 suits of chainmail, 15 shields, 30 longswords, 15 spears, 15 light crossbows and 500 bolts to a local lord. A small assortment of other weapons is stored with the rest.
8. Writing Materials (various prices): A small chest holds four blank books of high quality (each 30 gp) along with a sheaf of fine vellum (1 gp a sheet) and six fresh quills (5 sp each). Wisely, the merchant has stored the attendant inks (8 gp a vial) in a separate coffer.
9. Sarcophagi (absolutely [and suspiciously] not for sale): One wagon creaks under the load of four stone sarcophagi. Ornate scrollwork of an ancient type decorates the four sarcophagi all of which are tied shut with many bands of stout rope. The merchant is transporting these heavy goods to the sage Noora Tapatora in a nearby city. (What the sage wants with the sarcophagi and what—if anything—lies within could easily form an interesting adventure hook.)
10. Barrels of Red Wine (250 gp each): Each barrel holds five gallons of red wine and weighs 150 lbs. The wine is serviceable, but nothing special; it has not travelled well.
11. Cosmetics: Several small coffers hold an array of cosmetics, including face powder, henna, kohl, rouge and other essentials. Such items are destined for the rich folk of a nearby town. However, a rogue—or other nefarious type—could find some of the items useful for their disguise kit.
12. Large Cage (250 gp): This iron cage is large enough to hold two humans. It has a large hook attached to its roof, suggesting it is destined to be hung from somewhere.
13. Riding Horses (75 gp each): Four trained riding horses trot behind one of the wagons, led by their grooms. The merchant also has the requisite saddles, bits and bridles available (12 gp a set).
14. Hunting Falcon (100 gp): A trained hunting falcon— hooded for much of the day except when sent aloft— perches on one of the wagons under the watchful eye of its trainer. The falcon is destined to be sold to a noble; if the characters want it, they'll have to pay double!
15. Brilliant White Fur (50 gp): This bearskin is pure white, and is a rare find. The bearskin includes the creature's head, and would make a sumptuous rug or—without the head—an impressive cloak.
16. Cuneiform Fragments (200 gp): Odd, water-worn carvings decorate this fragment of black basaltic rock. The caving are illegible and so spells such as comprehend languages do not translate them. The stone fragment was recovered from the sea near the dismal village of Coldwater in northern Ashlar. What ancient secrets does it hold?
17. Chain Net (300 gp): This large and cumbersome net of chain links is designed to ensnare an owlbear, minotaur or similar large, powerful creature. It weighs 200 lbs. and requires at least four human-sized people to deploy, due to its bulk.
18. Lanterns of Everlight (100 gp) each: The wicks of these three lanterns has been treated with a continual light spell. The lanterns' hoods provide an easy way of controlling the everlasting magical light.
19. Battered Plate Armour (300 gp): Battered but serviceable, this suit of plate armour may require fitting for a new owner. Such a fitting costs 200 gp, but if a character actually fits the armour this is a great bargain.
20. Expensive Spell Components (various prices): The merchant possesses a small supply of expensive spell components they plan to sell to the wizards in the next town or city. They include pearls (100 gp each), pouches filled with powdered silver (50 gp each), diamond dust (in pouches costing 250 gp each) and so on. 





## CARAVAN DRESSING 



1. Each of the caravan's wagons has the sigil of its owner painted on the side. The quality of the painting is a good reflection of the owner's status and success.
2. Each of the carters has a loaded crossbow and club within easy reach; the carters are expected to contribute to the caravan's defence when required. Most have no intention of risking their lives if trouble should strike, and will be less than useful in a fight.
3. Several hangers-on have attached themselves to the caravan—either for safety or to earn a few coin. Such folk include a peddler, a handyman and two wandering mercenaries. All are available for hire.
4. Travel stained pennants and bunting hang forlornly from the sides of the caravan's wagons. Designed to be gaudy and to attract attention, the flags fail miserably at their job. (The merchant will have them cleaned when the caravan reaches its destination).
5. A bard travels with the caravan. Sitting atop one of the wagons, he (incessantly) plays his lute. Some enjoy his music, while others wish he would take a break. All that aside, however, the music carries for some distance—and could attract predators.
6. A powerful warhorse pulls one of the wagons. The horse is fully trained for war, and was given to the merchant in lieu of normal payment of a debt. The owner is happy to sell the horse—for a tidy profit—once the caravan has reached its destination.
7. A heavily armoured coach rumbles along as part of the caravan. The coach could be a rich merchant's personal conveyance or might be on the way to be delivered to a wealthy local. Alternatively, it could have been hired by a wealthy traveller intent on a safe journey.
8. A perceptive character notices the tracks left by one of the wagons are much deeper than the others. This suggests its load is heavier—and perhaps more valuable —than usual.
9. The caravan—along with the normal wagons and such— comprises a half-dozen sheep being driven to market. The sheep are noisy and slow, much to annoyance of the caravan's folk. The sheep are the source of many arguments between the merchants—and could attract predators to the train.
10. The caravan is well guarded. Twenty vigilant men-at-arms protect the train, suggesting something valuable is hidden somewhere among the wagons. The guards are so numerous that any regular group of bandits let the caravan pass unmolested.
11. The caravan has no guards—the previous mercenaries having deserted recently. The merchant offers the characters free upkeep and use of the caravan's fires if they accompany him to his destination. (He suggests they band together “for mutual protection”). The merchant is cheap, and always tries to get something for nothing. (Hence why the previous guards deserted).
12. The merchant is a stickler for appearances, and demands his servants and guards wear his specially design tabards—three gold coins on a sable background. Similarly designed banners hangs from his wagons.
13. Several of the wagons are in a bad state of repair, and are more likely to breakdown. Similarly, the horses pulling the wagons are not well looked after; perhaps the merchant is down on their luck or perhaps they don't care about appearances.
14. The caravan's wagons are gaudily painted. Each has the name of its owner daubed on the side, and many of the carters have secondary skills they are happy to ply. Their skills are listed under their names on the wagons. Each also carries with them the tools of their secondary trade.
15. A heavily armoured coach rumbles along in the middle of the caravan, protected by a half-dozen grim-faced, heavily armed warriors. The coach contains three heavy strongboxes holding gold and silver bars—payment to a local lord of a long overdue debt. Another man, Issu Seppo (LN male human wizard 8), clearly a noble rides in the coach, but keeps to himself as much as possible.
16. The merchant well understands the power of promotion and owns some atypical animals to pull the wagons. The animals could be mountains goats, camels, zebras or even something larger such as an elephant. Whenever, the caravan enters a settlement, its animals causes a stir.
17. One of the wagons belongs to a troop of wandering entertainers. They put on shows and entertainment at the drop of a hat. They are enthusiastic, but not talented. These entertainers could be exactly what they profess to be, or they could have a darker purpose—thieves preparing to rob the caravan or even assassins hunting their prey.
18. A small pack of stray dogs follow the caravan. The dogs trot alongside the wagons by day and beg around the campfires at night. Some of the servants and guards find the dogs intensely irritating, but all attempts to drive them away the pack fail.
19. A tinker travels with the caravan in a tall, covered wagon that clatters loudly as it bumps along the tray. The man Kauko Niera (N male human thief 3) is a genius when it comes to fixing things, and he can turn his hand to almost any trade. A vast array of tools fills his wagon.
20. An armoured war wagon trundles along in the caravan. Pulled by armoured warhorses and manned by a dozen longbow-armed men-at-arms it makes a formidable sight. When danger looms, the merchant retreats to the armoured wagon—which also holds their strongbox. 





## MINOR EVENTS 



1. The wheel on one of the wagons suddenly snaps, and the wagon lurches to one side. If the wagon was moving, the damage was caused by a deep pothole in the track. If the wagon was stationary, the cause is less clear. In any event, the wheel must be repaired before the wagon can move again.
2. Birds suddenly erupt noisily from a nearby tree, as if startled by an approaching predator. They flock together before flying off swiftly to the east.
3. One of the wagons abruptly veers off the trail and gets tangled in a bush. Investigation reveals the carter was asleep and/or had been drinking heavily. The wagon must be extricated before the caravan can continue on its way.
4. A dog darts between the wagons, barking furiously. It nips at the heels of one of the horses which rears up, neighing loudly. The carter struggles to control the horse, as the dog continues its attack.
5. Light rain falls on the caravan. Those that can take cover in its wagons and carriages. Those that cannot pull their cloaks up around their ears—resigned to a long, wet day.
6. A trio of beggars trail the caravan; when the caravan stops, they catch up and beg for food, shelter and coin. One of the three is a thief who waits for night to pilfer the merchant's choicest, most portable goods before fleeing back to town.
7. The caravan guards are jumpy; rumours of bandits, brigands and other marauders in the locality have rendered them suspicious toward strangers—particularly heavily armed strangers.
8. A band of hunters—carrying the pelts of several bears, wolves or other animals appropriate for the locale— approach the caravan to sell their wares. Vigorous haggling ensues. The hunters know the surrounding area well and may be able to provide the characters intelligence on nearby sites of interest.
9. One of the caravan's horses throws a shoe. This inevitably slows down or delays the caravan.
10. One of the (bored) caravan's guards or servants (see “Notable Guards & Servants') strikes up a conversation with the characters. They want to hear stories of the characters' adventures, and in return share a local legend or two (which could lead to a side trek).
11. An obstruction such as a fallen tree or landslide blocks the trail. If the blockage is not cleared, the caravan must find another way to reach it destination. This blockage could, of course, be the work of bandits or raiders.
12. A perceptive character notices the caravan is bigger than it was at the start of the day—another wagon has slipped in behind the procession. Two men—swarthy and clad in dirty leathers—sit on the wagon's bench, but a capacious bonnet obscures view of what the wagon actually carries.
13. An argument between two guards or servants leads to loud voices and a fistfight. The altercation stops the caravan or—if it is already stopped—brings all other activity to a halt.
14. The natural sounds of wildlife suddenly cease—as if the animals and birds in the surrounds sense something the merchant and their servants do not. Paranoid characters may suspect some kind of attack is imminent.
15. Faint screaming reaches the ears of the characters and many of the other folk in the caravan. The caravan guards draw their weapons, and the merchant asks for someone to scout ahead to make certain no dangers lurk on the road.
16. At the end of a break to rest the horses, a merchant realises one of his servants is missing. A quick search fails to turn up the missing man. Has he wandered off or has something unwholesome befallen him?
17. Dark cloud build up ominously above the caravan, and the wind strengthens. Those that can take cover in the wagons. Those that cannot are doomed to a wet and miserable day. It rains heavily all day.
18. A small patrol of light cavalry approaches the caravan. The soldiers are in the employ of the local lord and are charged with keeping the roads safe. They briefly chat with the merchant before cantering on. If treated well, the soldiers may relate rumours to the characters of local doings or legends. Perhaps one such story could lead to an interesting (or profitable) side trek.
19. A riding horse—without a rider but fully equipped with saddle, saddle bags and so on—canters passed the caravan. Several of the servants make half-hearted attempts to stop the horse. If the characters manage to stop it, they discover fresh blood on the saddle and on one of the horse's flanks. Where is the rider and what befell them?
20. The sound of soft, melodic singing reaches the characters' ears. Shortly thereafter, a single figure—a wandering bard—comes into view as she approaches the caravan. The bard, Mateli Paaso (NG female human fighter 6/thief 6/bard 2), has recently visited the caravan's next destination, and the merchant stops to chat with her. She may know nothing but rumours and news of events only of interest to a merchant or she might know things of interest to adventurers. 





# MINIONS OF EVIL 


## ASSASSINS & KILLERS 

1. KNUT JOUTSIMIES NE male human magic-user 7 This human man wears grey, soot-streaked robes. Burn scars cover the left half of his face and run down his neck. Knut glares at all those he meets and has a deep abiding love of fire. Personality: Knut enjoys killing his victims with fire, harming himself as he draws close to the fatal conflagrations. Though he takes contracts, he derives genuine pleasure from settling a grudge, even for something as simple as jostling him in a crowd. He uses magic to incapacitate his prey but never to set his fires. Mannerisms: The arsonist remains soft-spoken even when driven to anger. When Knut sees a poorly tended or uncontrolled fire, he quietly berates those responsible while making sure the fire burns “properly”. Hook: A baron requests help to investigate a series of deadly fires in his lands. The baron had hired Knut to assassinate political rivals and planned to imprison him before the killer could implicate the baron. Knut, aware of the treachery, seeks to make the baron his next victim.
2. MATILDA ASIKKA CE female human assassin 3 Garbed in clean peasant's clothing, this human woman wears her brown hair streaked through with grey in a neat bun. Matilda whispers secrets only she knows. Cursed with the ability to see major events in other people's futures she can sense those destined to perform great (or terrible) acts. Personality: Matilda assassinates those who will commit heinous acts should they live. Fearing her foreknowledge of her victims' potential future deeds marks her as a witch, she ensures she doesn't stand out. She desperately desires a confidante for her secret but has yet to find someone with an open mind who does not want to profit from her ability. Mannerisms: Despite Matilda's caution, she sometimes jerks her head about or shushes the whispering only she can hear. If she receives attention for her behaviour, she makes excuses (blaming a buzzing fly, sudden itch and so on). Hook: One of the characters has a recurring nightmare where Matilda stands over one of her recent victims. She relays the importance of the victim's death, mentions her location and speaks another name before everything turns to gibberish. Matilda will soon stand trial for the murder and likely faces conviction and a death sentence for the deed.
3. TIINA UNAJA NE female human thief 6 A warm smile crosses this red-haired human's face. She wears a tailored dress that hints at some level of wealth. Tiina schemes both to bring death and love to those she meets, Tiina is a complicated person. Personality: Tiina views her killings as works of art. She travels to larger settlements where she uses her charms to befriend two people who have shared interests. Once she has gained the trust of both marks, she kills one and frames the other, using her thieving skills to leave incriminating evidence at the murder scene. She has a gift for getting others to open up to her without sharing any of her own personal details. She likes to play matchmaker for people other than her targets and gets angry if her schemes fail. Mannerisms: The killer deflects questions about her past with casual attempts to change the subject or assurances about her boring life. Hook: Tiina sets her sights on one of the characters as the mark for her next scheme. 





## CLERICS & PRIESTS 

1. AATSO VAANIA NE male human cleric 5 The piercing blue eyes of this immaculately dressed young nobleman constantly scan the crowd but never seem to actually see anyone. Aatso obsesses over his appearance. This orphaned nobleman is always the target of gossip at gatherings. He is constantly attended by two silent guardians—skeletal champions under his power—completely hidden in black armour and silken veils. Personality: Bored of life and its pleasures Aatso began to look into the dark arts and found necromancy. He has no interest in gaining more wealth, only power. Mannerisms: Obsessed with illness and disease he only shows real interest in people suffering from some malady. Hooks: Aatso likes to watch the ill and the sick die. If there aren't enough ill or sick people he is happy to use his powers to increase the supply. The party may help one of Aatso's ill subjects which draws his ire. He sends undead to test the party's defences before moving in for the kill.
2. CHARLOTTA ASIKKA NE female human cleric 4 Beautiful green eyes and a perfect smile do nothing to draw your attention from this raven-haired woman's raw sexuality. Charlotta Asikka, the Devil in a Black Dress, stands alluringly, fully displaying the pleasures her perfect body could provide. Masquerading as a priestess of the god of love she is in fact a cruel-hearted woman delighting in the attention and power her looks give her. Personality: Constantly flirting and drawing attention to herself she always has several devoted lackeys ready to defend her. She wields her men like weapons, directing them where they will do the most damage. If caught out she plays the victim, drawing new suitors into her web of lies. Mannerisms: Charlotta stands in a way to draw attention to her ample assets and beauty. When nervous she giggles before answering questions, often reaching out to touch people or complimenting them to deflect difficult questions. Hooks: After making an agreement with a dark power to keep her looks Charlotta must sacrifice a beautiful woman once per year.
3. ELINA KEIRA NE female human cleric 4 A dazzling smile and mischievous eyes distract from this blonde innkeeper's whip-thin body. Elina greets customers with filled mugs and friendly conversation. Using the tavern as a front for her cult she lures drunk guests to the shrine below for sacrifice. Personality: A jester and performer to the core Elina cracks jokes to create a homely atmosphere before plunging a hooked knife into her bound captive's beating heart. Mannerisms: Elina likes to banter and is always refilling people's drinks for free. Her smile gets her lots of attention that she revels in despite her twisted ways. Hooks: A noble is looking for her son who disappeared recently, and Elina's tavern was the last place he was seen. Seemingly determined to help Elina tries to befriend the party and separate them before luring them one by one into her lair.
4. ESKA TAPO LE male human cleric 2 Small, fat and buck-toothed this greying middle-aged man leers stupidly at people as they pass him by. Eska never remains motionless. Clumsy beyond belief he is constantly knocking things over. Loving cruelty and torture he sold his soul to darkness and chaos at a young age. Personality: Dismissive and rude he watches out for fragile people to sacrifice to the darkness. Mannerisms: Cowardly to the bone Eska flinches away from danger and threats and sweats profusely in combat. Hooks: The party come across one of Eska's victims bound and mutilated—but alive—in an alley. Watching from the shadows Eska is enraged by the party's interference and plots revenge.
5. KREETA TAPATORA CE female half-orc cleric 3 This tall, buxom half-orc woods-woman watches people around her paying more attention to what they are wearing than who they are. Kreeta stands proud, displaying her elaborate leather armour. After being taunted by her first party she snapped and gave into the whispering voices, killing her companions while they slept. She now uses expertly tanned human skin disguised as decoration on her armour to venerate the beastly powers she serves. Personality: Kreeta has very little experience with men and is awkward around them. If flirted with, she becomes childishly surly. Mannerisms: Kreeta's first love is leather and she always admires the work of others. A careful observer may notice how she stares intently at patches of bare skin. Hooks: Looking for companions Kreeta attempts to join the party as a guide. Before they return to town she attempts to slay them in their sleep and take choices bits of their hides to improve her armour's decoration. 





## FIGHTERS & WARRIORS 

1. ALEKSI UNTI NE male human fighter 4 Tall, dark and slender, this man's apparel reflects the expert commander and tactician he is. Aleksi stands rigid like a soldier at attention; his appearance is perfect as if he is ready for a parade ground inspection. Personality: Sociopathic and arrogant to the core, Aleksi lives to lead his small group of evil mercenaries and completes the mundane tasks given to him by his unscrupulous employers. Egotistical beyond measure he firmly believes the world must obey him. Mannerisms: Direct to the point of bluntness Aleksi uses concise sentences if he speaks at all. He directs his soldiers with gestures and nods as if everywhere is a battlefield. Hooks: The party attracts Aleksi's attention due to their shoddy appearance, poorly maintained kit or just because he glanced at them for a second too long. He obsessively fixates on them and their shoddy standards.
2. HILDA SALME LE female human fighter 4 This bedraggled woman wears a worn-out military uniform and hides her face behind her tangled dark hair. Hilda stares intently into the distance—her face a mask of rage. A lone survivor, she was captured and tortured by the enemy before breaking free. Unfortunately, the ordeal broke her mind leaving her a raging beast inside. Personality: Snarling she snaps answers to questions abruptly. The longer a conversation lasts the more twitchy Hilda gets until she storms off without a word. Mannerisms: Raging inside Hilda is constantly arguing with herself; sometimes she snaps aloud at people long dead. Her only solace is with the small birds she feeds and pets to quiet her raging mind. Hooks: One of the party looks like the enemy leader who tortured her and she immediately sets about exacting revenge. Expert at separating enemies and ambush tactics she retreats to re-plan her assault when beaten.
3. KARI RAHIKKA CE male human fighter 3 Stinking of cologne this huge man's muscles strain against his clothes as if trying to escape; this is a look he seems to have deliberately cultivated. Kari glares at everyone. A consummate bully he delights in picking on people and intimidating tavern owners. Personality: Boorish and moronic Kari spends most of his time leering at women and glaring at men. He has no friends, only idiot cronies who follow him out of fear. Mannerisms: When not picking his nose or staring blankly into the distance Kari drinks heavily. He has no respect or consideration for anyone. Hooks: Fed up with Kari's loutish behaviour the owner of a tavern or a friendly barmaid discreetly asks for help getting rid of him. Unfortunately, Kari and his cronies return to the tavern afterwards to exact violent revenge on everyone who might have been involved.
4. LADY DOROTHEA OTRA LE female half-elf fighter 3 Peeking through her perfectly straight blonde hair this woman's mesmerising golden eyes seem to draw you to her. Lady Dorothea leans heavily on a sturdy cane in the wake of a long-ago accident yet maintains the haughty demeanour of a noblewoman. Due to her mixed-race, her family is shunned by other nobles who make cruel jokes at her expense. Growing up in upper society she has become a vile creature constantly seeking to bring others low with her schemes. Personality: She is the epitome of a haughty noblewoman taking great delight in humiliating anyone she chooses. Anyone immune to her scorn is brought to the attention of her servants who harass and occasionally kidnap people to torture in the cellars of her large house. She loves combat and is deadly using her cane as a weapon. Mannerisms: She flies into a rage if her twisted leg is mentioned despite the accident which took her mobility happening years ago. Hooks: Any elves in the party, or perhaps an elven friend falls into Dorothea's orbit and immediately becomes the target of her ire. One night, her servants try to capture them and drag them to her manor to entertain their lady.
5. PEKOE TALVEKKI CE male half-orc fighter 3 This bald, ugly, dough-faced man wears shoddy, bulging leathers sewn with chain mail patches. Pekoe hates excessive exercise—and he considers almost all exercise excessive. Personality: Vindictive and cruel, Pekoe delights in causing horrible wounds and torturing his opponents to death. He delicately uses his spike-backed battleaxe to cause as much pain to his victims as possible. Mannerisms: Viewing personal hygiene as something for other people Pekoe stinks of sweat and blood. He takes great delight in the reactions his presence causes. He is as obnoxious as possible breaking wind and belching in people's faces before bursting out in hysterical laughter. Hook: A torturer by trade he was laid off for enjoying his work too much. Now he seeks employment with unsavoury characters. The party have upset such a character and find themselves on the receiving end of Pekoe's attention. 





## SORCERERS & WIZARDS 

1. HETA TALVIKKI NE old female human wizard 9 Deep laughter lines frame the face of this elderly human woman, whose infectious smile and bright eyes make her stand out from any crowd. Heta grins at a private joke no one else would find funny. Personality: Heta's pleasant exterior belies a cruel and vicious nature. Few can imagine the depths she is willing— even eager to plumb—in pursuit of her pleasure. Mannerisms: Always smiling, Heta offers everyone cuddles, sweets and grandmotherly advice as she travels between settlements. She gives special attention to children. Hook: Heta travels between settlements, playing the part of the friendly traveller while collecting information on potential targets to be raided by her master. Children disappear in her wake, never to be seen again; a group of heroes might hear of these disappearances, and be compelled to investigate.
2. KALLE LEMMINKÄINEN LN male human evoker 4 Horrible burns cover much of this man's lower face; a thick brown cloak covers most of his body. A well-worn tool belt and several metal flasks can be seen beneath the cloak. Kalle creates complicated machines and contraptions to inflict pain and suffering on the wielder's foes. Most such inventions involve the use of fire—a lot of fire. Personality: Loyal to a fault, Kalle's personal code of honour binds him like iron. He rarely smiles unless involved in the making of a new gadget or magical creation. Mannerisms: Kalle incessantly fidgets, as if needing to keep busy. He appears distracted and rarely looks anyone in the eye, which frustrates many that meet him. Hook: Kalle was rescued from a terrible fire two years ago. Despite knowing how villainous his saviour can be, he is bound by a strict code of honour and serves by creating new tools for his master's other minions to use. Adventurers may want to investigate the source of their foes' unusual arsenal.
3. LYYLI VESS CE female dwarf wizard 3 This tall, feminine dwarf has her luxurious braided beard adorned with colourful gemstones, and her golden hair is intricately woven down her back. She wears a fashionable red dress and silver rings sparkle on each finger. Lyyli fascinates many people she meets with her “undwarven” style and ways. Personality: Charming and flirty, Lyyli challenges dwarven stereotypes in many ways. Always smiling, she is the life of the party. Almost heretically, she prefers silver over gold, sips wine, and seems to enjoy the company of elves. Mannerisms: Lyyli likes to be physically close to others, often touching or stroking exposed skin. She has a fondness for sweet wines and is delighted to dance the night away with anyone she takes a shine to. Hook: There is a secret that must be uncovered, and the dwarven socialite, Lyyli, is known to be a trove of information. Her costs are high, and sometimes also exotic and cruel; she asks for the local elven delegation to be publicly humiliated. 





## THIEVES & SPIES 

1. BRUSI KUKURTAJA LE male human thief 9 The rigours of time crease this lithe man's face. His balding pate and a slight limp in his left leg further betray his age. Brusi boasts of past glories and acts of breathtaking daring. Personality: Brusi has participated in several heists and dungeon delves where he narrowly escaped death. Time has caught up with him, but he is in deep denial about his diminished capabilities. He would prefer to finish his career in a blaze of glory rather than quietly retire. Mannerisms: Eager to prove himself, Brusi readily accepts dangerous challenges. He often steers conversations toward his past exploits, inflating the challenges he overcame and downplaying the contributions of others. Hook: Brusi has learned about an unexplored tomb filled with impossible traps and deadly monsters. He searches for a group to explore and plunder the tomb. Though a capable thief, Brusi takes unnecessary risks during the exploration.
2. JYRKI VENEMIES N male human thief 1 This fresh-faced lad wears a scruffy beard in an attempt to appear older. His dark hair is tied back into a ponytail. Jyrki paces incessantly, his mind a whirl of schemes and plans. Jyrki has plans. Personality: Jyrki seeks to enter an elite organisation of spymasters and constantly looks for his break by learning a crucial secret or uncovering an earth-shattering plot. He tries to attach himself to people of import, so he can pump them for information or at least be present at key moments. Mannerisms: Jyrki does a poor job of concealing his overeager attitude and often inserts himself into conversations where he is not welcome. Hook: Jyrki overhears vital information that will have a major impact on the region. He botched his attempt to scurry away with the secret, marking himself as a target for assassination. He turns to the characters, whom he recently met (and probably annoyed), for aid.
3. NIKOTEEMUS REPO N male human druid 5 Dressed in a bright green cloak and carrying a gnarled oaken staff, this human with unruly hair gleefully greets birds who alight on his shoulders. Nikoteemus whistles a wordless tune to attract any birds who seem attracted to him. Personality: The druid exploits animals to obtain information and steal tiny but expensive treasures. He prefers birds for this, having discovered most people overlook the animals or at least don't chase them away. He is far more comfortable with animals than people. Mannerisms: Nikoteemus has taken on many of his avian friends' characteristics. He hops about when excited, ruffles his own hair, and chirps and whistles while he speaks. Hook: A wererat gang has recently claimed the sewers. The druid has stopped seeing rats in the city, and the birds he has sent to investigate die of a fast-acting poison before they can relay any news. He has no choice but to rely on twolegged minions to identify the threat.
4. SIKKE ARIJOUTSI NE female human cleric 3/thief 3 This fair-skinned, raven-haired woman wears purple and velvet robes. A holy symbol hangs from her silver necklace. Sikke Arijoutsi grins at the thought of luring someone else into her dark cult. Personality: Seemingly generous and empathetic, Sikke endears herself to everyone she meets. Despite her aristocratic appearance, she is a social chameleon, speaking politely to those of higher station but not afraid to carouse with those on society's lower rungs. She knows, her new minions can be found anywhere. Mannerisms: Sikke fidgets with her holy symbol and becomes genuinely shocked if someone presumes she is waiting for an opening to discuss her deity. She listens with rapt attention to stories about forgotten magical relics. Hook: She undertakes a holy mission to liberate and return items she or her church deems dangerous in the hands of others. Realising she can't perform her task alone, Sikke enlists help from like-minded (or naive) people.
5. VENLA JUTIKKA CN female human thief 5 Wearing comfortable clothing suitable for sea travel, this woman stands just over five feet tall. She keeps her light brown hair closely cut and wears a patch over her right eye. Venla watches with her “one good eye”—and her other equally good eye. Venla has everyone believing she is partially blind. This is a clever ruse designed to aid her numerous disguises. Personality: Venla is a cheery sort who won't turn down a pint and sometimes offers to buy a round in whatever ramshackle wharf pub she finds herself. She puts people at ease so she can gather information from and about them. Mannerisms: This information broker often adopts a casual pose, with her “good” eye closed. However, the cunningly woven mesh in her eyepatch gives her a nearperfect view of her surroundings. Hook: The party is alerted to an imminent pirate attack, one shrouded in secrecy regarding the fleet's size and the time of the attack. Venla has the information the party seeks and parts with it once they do her a rather odious favour. 





# NECROMANCER' S LAIR 


## BLASPHEMOUS TOMES 



1. Libermorbus: This seemingly innocuous book acts like a virus, piercing other tomes with tendrils of ink and replacing their stories with its own disturbing utterings. A creature who reads the text gains knowledge of infectious madness but also becomes a vector for its linguistic plague.
2. The Putrid Tome: The Putrid Tome reeks of human waste and rotting flesh. Its curdled green pages rot flesh and putrefy the eyes, so it must be handled with the greatest care. A creature able to withstand its fetid words gains power over decay and disease.
3. The Rat's Nest: The Rat's Nest was written into the very fabric of the world, and cannot be unwritten. No matter how many copies are burned, the text continues to appear through arcane symbols in the filth of the world. A passing mage may notice patterns in grey mould spores or rat nests, and, fascinated by the strange runes, translate the scripture into legible text before succumbing to insanity. A creature who reads The Rat's Nest learns the secret of eternal life through the sacrifice of humanity.
4. The Sable Flame: The Sable Flame is at all times consumed by a black fire that burns all but its own pages. Souls devoured by the flame scream for release. A reader gains mastery over the creation of burning skeletons and other fiery undead.
5. Sacralexicon: The secrets within this book are enough to shatter the piety of even the most devout holy man. Each god listed in its infinite index is implicated on a single page of undeniable truths. A creature able to withstand its secrets and see past the rotten falsehoods at the core of every deity gains divine power beyond that of mere mortals.
6. The Sanguine Resurrection: The text in this apparently blank book only appears with a healthy dose of blood. Each of the thirteen chapters requires an entire human's worth of blood and gore. It lists the process and ingredients needed for the resurrection of vampires and their ilk.
7. The Skin Tome: The words of this tome can only be tattooed on a living human's flesh—they disappear if written on any other surface. As a result, the “book” is often chained down and gagged for study. While reading the text itself does not necessarily induce insanity, the steps necessary to acquire and study the human subject might.
8. Vivomoira: Once read, Vivomoira is never silent. It whispers of betrayal, filling the reader with such paranoia that they eventually suspect their own skin and flesh. Suicide in self-defence is the most common cause of death, for a reader of Vivomoira. The book holds the knowledge of how to raise (and control) ghosts and other incorporeal undead. 

## BLASPHEMOUS BOOKMARKS 



1. This dried and cured tongue smells slightly of rot and decay. A rune of death is inscribed into the tongue.
2. A slender wafer-thin sliver of bone—perhaps harvested from some unfortunate's leg—has intricate images of torture and death carved into both sides.
3. A mouldering finger complete with a chipped, blackened nail.
4. A thick strip of woven hair comprising contributions from a mixture of redheads and blondes.
5. A single softly glowing white feather of almost unearthly beauty splattered with dried blood. Perceptive characters may suspect this feather was plucked from some kind of celestial being—perhaps even an angel!
6. A thin silver chain is affixed to a tarnished iron locket. The locket holds a minute portion of fine grey dust. 





## BLASPHEMOUS SPELL COMPONENTS 



1. This small pouch contains the jumbled finger bones of a mass murderer. Each of the bones has a different sigil carved into it; the necromancer uses these bones to divine the future.
2. A shrivelled, desiccated heart fills this small silken drawstring sack. If someone touches the heart with their bare skin, it seems to shiver slightly. If burnt, it gives off a noxious, cloying stench.
3. The necromancer places this pair of thin bone counters over the eyes of corpses during his gruesome experiments and rituals. One side of each counter is etched with symbols of death and decay.
4. This parchment of flayed skin displays an anatomical diagram of a human, with all the major organs prominently depicted. Notations around the diagram explain the best methods of removing the organs while keeping the subject alive as long as possible.
5. This waterskin holds a black, turgid liquid. Investigation reveals the liquid to be water mixed with ash.
6. Dried blood coats the blade of this small ceremonial wrought iron knife.
7. Carved from a single piece of bone, this sacrificial dagger has a crude, uncomfortable handle. Clearly not designed for combat, it has a more sinister purpose.
8. A small sealed earthen pot holds a dully glimmering crimson paste. Investigation reveals it to be blood mixed with powdered gemstones.
9. A fine mix of powdered silver and bone fills several small packets nestled in a tightly-wrapped waterproof pouch.
10. This horribly misshapen rat or mouse skull is wrapped in a square of red silk. The skull has the base of a single horn growing from its forehead. Shadows cluster thickly—perhaps even disturbingly— inside the skull's eye sockets.
11. Carved from some kind of hard black rock, this rough figurine depicts a skeletal man sitting cross-legged. The top of the figurine's skull is shiny and smooth—as if it has been caressed by countless hands.
12. This partially burnt crimson candle stands about six inches high. Its wick comprises tightly bound strands of blonde hair treated with some kind of slowburning oil. The candle gives off a pungent smell reminiscent of burning flesh when burnt.
13. A wired four-foot-long snake skeleton lies coiled in this pouch. The snake's skull still has its fangs. Close inspection reveals dried blood on the fangs and splatters of blood inside the skeleton.
14. Crumbling clumps of dried, noisome lifeless earth fill this small pouch.
15. This over-sized glass vial holds a turgid, cloudy liquid. The liquid holds three eyeballs in suspension. Anyone shaking the vial may be in for a shock.
16. Six small onyx gems individually wrapped in bloody sackcloth. Each gem has the arcane symbol of death carved into its surface. (A character skilled in spellcasting may determine these are components designed to increase the efficacy of animate dead and similar spells).
17. A single long fang attached to a shard of bone. This is a vampire's fang—it might be the only surviving fragment of the legendary vampire Gallowburn, and could even imprison a fragment of his soul.
18. Fine grey dust fills this small silver box to the brim. The box has a tiny lock; the necromancer has hidden the key in a secret compartment in his belt suggesting the dust is valuable in some way. Only perceptive characters find the key.
19. A strip of dirty, tightly woven bandages faintly inscribed with various ancient runes dealing with death, the afterlife and guardianship. A character steeped in undead lore identifies the bandages as a fragment of a mummy's wrapping.
20. A badly repaired plain cast iron amulet, sundered by a single sword blow or the like hangs around the necromancer's neck on a silver chain. The amulet had a (now empty) small hidden niche within. This was a lich's phylactery the necromancer has recovered to aid his own diabolical research into the afterlife. 





## THINGS IN A NECROMANCER' S SANCTUM 



1. A wooden box contains a dozen thin, long black candles. When burnt, they give off an indescribable smell akin to burning flesh.
2. Seven skulls fill a shelf above the desk. A strange rune decorates each skull's forehead.
3. A coffer near one wall holds a jumble of horribly misshapen bones. Most are of humanoid origin, but surely no creature could have survived long with such deformities.
4. An ornate display of bones decorates the ceiling. Leg and arm bones form the perimeter of the “sculpture” while a circle of skulls fills the centre. The bones are yellowing and old and have been stuck in place with strong glue. One of the skulls contains a bead from a necklace of fireballs. If the skull is disturbed, the bead falls out and explodes when it hits the floor.
5. A fireplace pierces one wall. Deep soot and ash lie within. Even a cursory examination of the pile turns up fragments of bone.
6. A small red velvet pouch contains a single braid of long impossibly red hair. The braid is carefully curled up and has been dusted with some kind of fine black dust.
7. A skull—with its top removed—serves as a mixing bowl of sorts. A nearby worn leg bone hints at its use as a pestle.
8. A small sack of salt lies on one corner. It is half empty and the remaining discoloured salt looks contaminated.
9. A large earthen jar of honey contains the preserved head of an old man. His face is contorted as if in indescribable agony.
10. Three small glass jars hold an array of different coloured dust. Each is the ash of a different cremated creature, used for some ineffable purpose. A different esoteric sigil has been carefully written on each jar.
11. A chandelier crafted of bones hangs down from the ceiling in the centre of the room. The bones are blackened with soot and covered in dried wax.
12. A small cauldron blackened with use and pitted with age stands near the necromancer's worktable. Dark, unnaturally cold water fills the cauldron almost to the lip. Within lies the sludge and detritus of many experiments —shattered bones, decaying flesh and the like.
13. A sagging bookshelf holds the remains of ancient tomes long since succumbed to the ravages of extreme age.
14. A small box contains four long bone quills. Their tips are exquisitely sharp and discoloured with red “ink".
15. A partially dissected body lies on the table. The body is that is a long-dead human. The unfortunate's chest cavity has been opened and the organs removed.
16. An ornate pentagram carving on the floor provides a zone of protection around the necromancer's workbench and desk. The carvings have been picked out with blood.
17. Several beakers stand on a shelf above the table. Each is full of a different kind of dark, sticky and noxious fluid.
18. An oversized leather wallet holds a dissection kit. Incongruously, the leather wallet is of the finest quality and is even beautifully monogrammed with the necromancer's initials.
19. A small cage hanging from the ceiling holds the skeletal remains of several songbirds amid a small heap of discoloured feathers. Hideously, the birds' remains yet stir and judder. A close examination reveals they appear to still be trying to sing.
20. The room seems unnaturally cold and the party's nonmagical lights do not dispel the darkness lingering in the room's nooks and crannies. Anyone spending much time here gets the feeling that unseen presences lurk in the chamber. 

## PICKLED & PRESERVED THINGS 



1. A large jar of cloudy vinegar is full of severed ears cut from a variety of races.
2. An orc's disembodied head steeped in crystallised honey fills an earthen jar. Its face is frozen in a snarl.
3. A faerie or sprite's tiny body is pinned to a large slab of wood cut from the heartwood of a dryad's tree. The body yet occasionally quivers.
4. A box crafted from carefully joined finger and toe bones holds a suspiciously well-preserved heart along with several glistening strands of platinum blond hair (which are carefully draped over the heart).
5. A large box holds a dry paste of powder bones mixed with blood and other bodily fluids.
6. A wooden frame holds a stretched and drying ragged patch of skin roughly a foot square. (The necromancer is turning the skin into a scroll.) Part of a faded tattoo is visible on one edge of the “scroll”. 





## HORRIBLE SENSATIONS 



1. The air suddenly becomes preternaturally cold. The characters can see their breath and frost begins to form on any exposed pieces of metal.
2. One of the characters begins to shiver uncontrollably, although the air temperature has not changed. The shakes continue for a few minutes before subsiding.
3. Suddenly, one of the characters suffers an out-of-body experience. Up by the ceiling, the character has the strange sensation of looking down at the party. After a few minutes, the feeling ends and the character is “sucked” back into their own body.
4. A thin opaque mist blankets the floor. As the characters move through it, cold and clammy tendrils rise up from the mist to clutch at the explorers' legs.
5. A deep throbbing passes through the nearby floor and walls. Several of the party feel somewhat dizzy. The feeling subsides, after a few moments.
6. The least perceptive hero gets the strong feeling they are being watched by some nearby, hidden observer.
7. Something invisible bumps into the rear-most character causing them to stumble. Nothing is obviously present and the event does not repeat itself.
8. One of the characters feels the hot breath of some unseen creature on the back of their neck.
9. The sensation of a thick miasma of hopelessness and death hangs heavily in the air. In this area, things seem glummer and the situation more hopeless.
10. The air moves more vigorously than in surrounding areas. Faint, but sporadic gusts of wind stir the characters' hair. From the corner of their eyes, several characters glimpse snatches of translucent faces—their expressions fixed with hopelessness and despair—drifting through the air. 

## HORRIBLE SOUNDS 



1. Uncontrollable screaming suddenly rends the air. It continues for several seconds before abruptly ceasing.
2. A soft sobbing, from an undeterminable source, reaches the characters' ears.
3. The clanking of chains and the thud of something falling sunders the quiet.
4. A soft cackling comes from the room the party just left.
5. Moaning—perhaps the wind or the damned spirits of those the necromancer has transformed into the undead —echoes through the area. The moaning rises and falls in intensity for several minutes, before dying away.
6. A loud clatter—perhaps that of falling stones or a collapsing skeleton—reaches the party's ears. Moments later, a skull rolls into view around the corner. Investigation reveals a pile of mouldering bones.
7. Everyone in the party hears several loud thuds emanating from an unexplored direction. Only perceptive characters hear the ensuing cackling and low whining sounds coming from the same direction.
8. The distant clacking of bone on stone suggests that somewhere out of sight, an animate skeleton—or two— patrols the halls.
9. Loud maniacal laughter sounds from somewhere deeper into the complex.
10. A loud thunderclap rends the stillness of the air. As it echoes through the complex, the hair on the back of the characters' neck suddenly rises as if some electrical charge—or other fell energy—fills the air. 







# NOBLE' S MANOR HOUSE 







## NOTABLE THINGS OUTSIDE 



1. The boundaries of this well-groomed hedge maze stand 12 feet tall. Topiaries of various predators (bears, lions, tigers and wolves) in fearsome stances fill circular chambers dotting the easily navigated path. The maze's centre chamber features a towering owlbear as tall as the maze's hedges.
2. A stable and exercise field announces itself with the sounds of snorting and whinnying, as well as a unique odour if the wind blows in the right direction. Four stablehands live in nearby quarters and tend the horses. Half of the stable's fourteen stalls are occupied.
3. A lush garden takes up an eighth of an acre. Yellow and purple blossoming flowers dominate the view, as oversized bees busily buzz among them.
4. A granite sundial stands in a clearing, granting it full access to the sun throughout the day. In moonlight, the granite glows an iridescent blue. The sundial's gnomon measures ten feet in length. Careful inspection of the gnomon's base finds rust-red spatters, indicative of dried blood.
5. Four stone dolphins rise five feet from the centre of this fountain and spray water from their blowholes and mouths. The basin stands two-foot-tall, and carved sea serpent statues encircle it. Etchings of narwhals, mermaids, octopuses and stranger sea creatures ornament the basin's outer side.
6. Wooden scaffolding for an active building project to add a wing to the manor house remains hidden from view when approaching the manor's front entrance. Several tarps heaped on the ground stand ready to protect the scaffolding from inclement weather.
7. Stone statues of three-foot-tall knights top the roof on all sides of the manor house. A mechanism allows them to “patrol” back and forth ten feet in either direction for thirty minutes, after which the mechanism must be reset.
8. Brightly coloured ribbons festoon this maypole, which stands 12 feet tall. Various wreaths and flowered garlands lie in piles next to the maypole.
9. A pair of alabaster winged lions rear up on their hindlegs at the base of stairs leading to the main entrance. A wheel at the leftmost lion's base turns the lions to face each other, creating an archway where their paws meet above the stairs.
10. Pennants emblazoned with two crests other than the noble's line the major paths around the manor. An astute observer notes the banners portend a treaty between the two houses or an attempt at an alliance between the noble and their two guests of honour.
11. The noble's children have started a construction project: a sailboat measuring 100 feet long. They have completed the hull and the masts, but the boat is several days away from seaworthiness. Oddly, the nearest body of water capable of supporting the boat is dozens of miles distant.
12. A pair of carriages stand beneath a standalone awning. The larger carriage, pulled by a team of eight horses, has room for twelve passengers to sit in relative comfort. The smaller carriage allows for up to four horses to draw it and holds four passengers. 





## NOTABLE THINGS INSIDE 



1. The manor's main staircase winds around a central marble pillar. At every tenth step, a detachable glass globe containing a candle sits atop the railing. A servant lights the candles at dusk, allowing inhabitants and visitors to navigate the staircase safely.
2. A thick blue velvet carpet, embroidered with gold and featuring the family's coat of arms, runs through the house's hallways. Rooms reserved for the noble's family and honoured guests contain the same carpet.
3. A mahogany table with twenty ornately carved mahogany chairs surrounding it speaks to this room's purpose as a dining hall. Servants light over a hundred candles in the chandeliers hanging over the table to illuminate the room when in use.
4. One chamber has recently taken considerable damage from an errant siege weapon. As a sudden storm rolls in, the house's staff goes into a flurry of action to throw tarps over the remains.
5. A brick wall blocks one of the doorways on the ground floor. Anyone asked about the wall claims it has always been there, replies evasively or changes the subject.
6. Two dozen suits of ornamental full plate flank the main hall. Each suit has a gauntlet suitable for a weapon and can pose so the weapons form an archway.
7. Regardless of the time of day, only the west facing windows remain uncovered. Heavy curtains cover the east facing windows, and a servant rushes over to replace any curtain disturbed by a guest or visitor.
8. A square comprising eight rows of eight smaller squares alternating between black and white fills this chamber. A pair of ten-foot-wide, four-foot-deep wardrobes complete the room. Each cabinet contains chess pieces, either black or white, ranging in height from two feet for the pawns to four feet for the king and queen. Stylised costumes representing each piece, in the appropriate colour, hang in the wardrobe's back.
9. The manor's residents and staff refer to one of the house's wings as the “Hall of Remembrance” for the portraits of the noble family's forbears. Most portraits are standard fare, where the subject sat and posed for the painter, but some have sinister or grotesque aspects. When questioned, a family member states, “Some of our ancestors earned their poor reputations, and these paintings were completed posthumously. They remind us to treat others well.”
10. Maple wainscotting, reaching three feet up from the floor, runs along the walls in every room in the manor. A keen eye spots a loose section in one of the hallways.
11. Rather than extending the walls to accommodate an additional storey, the builders lowered the ceilings for the ground floor to a height of six feet, generating a sense of claustrophobia.
12. Shelves line every wall in this library, which also contains a long table and a pair of comfortable chairs. Many books deal with the region's history, but a corner section hosts tomes pertaining to different pantheons, some of which have no practicing worshippers. The books are in a variety of languages, some long dead.
13. The manor house has four wings, each built along a cardinal direction. Each wing has motifs appropriate for a specific season depending on its cardinal direction. North represents winter, east has vibrant spring displays, south features summer themes, and west has a resplendent autumnal array.
14. At the end of a little-used hall an empty chamber has a bed of soil for a floor. Supposedly, the wood covering the earth warped and needs replacing. However, discussing the state of the floor with any staff evokes a response where the person speaks a quick word to a deity or touches a religious symbol.
15. All interior doors are stout oak and have thin iron bands, making them difficult to open or close. However, they might provide a few moments' delay to intruders who must force the doors open.
16. This long, narrow room serves as a place to spar. The racks filled with rapiers, swords and other weapons, as well as padding for the torso and face shields, reinforce this room's purpose. Straw helps cushion falls. The occasional blood spatter demonstrates some duels became heated or lethal.
17. To cut the omnipresent chill suffusing the manor, fireplaces feature in every chamber. Most remain lit throughout the night, but some go dormant during daylight hours when the sun warms the house. A red dragon adorns the entablature of each fireplace but never in the same location.
18. A tall chamber with a skylight hosts a fossilised leviathan, which a distant ancestor allegedly discovered in a driedout lake. A close survey of the creature reveals some incongruity in the bones, but they otherwise come from a single specimen.
19. Each door lintel in the manor is made of bronze, etched with a quotation from one of the family's ancestors.
20. A ballroom holds a stage large enough for a sizeable orchestra. The room's sound quality allows for readings or performances of plays, for which the staff carry in rows of wooden chairs. 





## MINOR DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. Blaring horns and baying dogs break the morning calm as various members of the house prepare for a hunt of something other than mundane foxes or deer.
2. The household is abustle as news spreads of an unexpected visit by dignitaries, either nobles of higher station, or those of the same rank with whom the manor's noble wishes to make a good impression. The staff goes into a flurry of cleaning and polishing, while some members frantically search for a red carpet to roll out for the impending arrival.
3. Several servants stand together and share the latest gossip about the noble family. When they notice a noble or guest nearby, they break up and go about their normal daily business.
4. Music echoes through the manor house as performers practice before their dinner concert and post-dinner accompaniment. A quick argument breaks out between musicians before the director soothes tempers.
5. Two cats tear through the hallways—the larger white long-haired cat chasing a smaller tabby. The smaller cat hisses and spits as it dashes away from its pursuer. Not far behind, an exasperated servant with broom in hand chases the felines.
6. A pair of horse riders break away from the exercise field, either through their choice or because they lost control of their mounts. They manage to guide their horses to leap over obstacles, including people, as they steer the animals back toward the stables.
7. One of the noble family's children follows visitors around the manor house, asking people to play with them or barraging people with (oftentimes personal) questions. The child meets blatant displays of frustration or anger with threats to tattle to one of their parents.
8. To relieve the heat on this unseasonably warm day, the staff have opened all possible windows in hopes of a cross-breeze. They also set out water pitchers to ensure no one becomes dehydrated. Some servants stationed near the house's entrance carry fans to cool off residents and guests alike.
9. One of the house dogs growls and raises its hackles at anyone who approaches. The animal doesn't attack anyone who stays at a distance but snaps at the hands and legs of someone who gets within lunging range. One of the staff lures the dog away with some kibble and softly spoken words.
10. A light shower (or gentle snow fall in winter) unexpectedly strikes the manor house, but ceases an hour later as suddenly as it started. 

## MINOR NIGHT-TIME EVENTS 



1. A cryptic knock sounds at one of the servants' doors, at the rear of the house. Another pattern of knocks responds to the first set. Whispered words pass between the scullery maid and a cloaked and hooded figure. The figure produces a box and presents it to the maid before riding off into the darkness.
2. With an early morning ahead for the head of the household, the kitchen staff begins their day well before dawn. They try to keep the noise of trays clattering and plates stacking to a minimum. However, even if the sounds from the kitchen don't rouse nearby sleepers, the smells of cooking meat and baking bread prove challenging to ignore.
3. A young noble sneaks away with a member of the staff to an unoccupied building. The pair look around constantly to check if someone has noticed them.
4. One of the house's residents sleepwalks through the halls and mutters about delivering an important missive. When the sleepwalker encounters a guest, the sleepwalker looks delighted, speaks gibberish for a minute and then returns to bed. This pattern repeats itself with a different resident the following night.
5. Wind sweeps through the manor house, creating eerie noises. Limbs belonging to trees near the house sway in the wind and thump against the outer wall. Finally, the attic floor creaks to complete the haunting soundscape.
6. A servant goes through her nightly rounds, snuffing out candles in quiet hallways and locking doors, sometimes to occupied rooms.
7. A colony of bats awakens and flies through a window accidentally left open. The bats' screeching and screams from surprised inhabitants create a cacophony until the bats leave the manor house. The bats return to their roost in the attic, an hour before dawn.
8. Thanks to the threat of attack from a rival noble, the family has hired additional guards to patrol the surrounds. On each half hour, calls of “all clear” ring across the estate.
9. To celebrate their lord's recent victory, servants build a giant bonfire and light it just before sundown. Several celebrants remain at the bonfire sharing stories and cheering through the small hours of the morning.
10. A rider dismounts from her horse and frantically pounds on the front door until someone answers it. She desires sanctuary from the people chasing her and claims she has no idea why they are after her. She keeps a vigil all night, watching from a window for her pursuers. 





## PIECES OF MINOR DRESSING 



1. Weaponry fills racks in several chambers. The noble seems proud of the collection of martial weapons, most of which are decorative and fall apart with a strong blow. However, a discerning eye spots combat-ready weapons, useful in defence of the manor in case of an intrusion, scattered among the others.
2. Tapestries around the manor house tell a story about the hunt for a bizarre questing beast. The first tapestry shows the gathering of the hunters, their steeds and their dogs. The second tapestry shows the hunting party finding the beast's tracks. The third tapestry details a gruesome attack by the beast, which kills several dogs. The next tapestry shows the beast filled with arrows, and the final tapestry shows the hunting party celebrating around the beast's corpse, with a few dogs standing triumphantly on the creature's chest.
3. The library and other bookshelves in appropriate rooms all have at least one copy of a book detailing the history of the noble family.
4. A pair of crossed halberds hangs in the middle of a large hall. One of the halberds gleams in the light, seemingly unused in battle, while the other has a warped haft and pitted, bloodstained blade. No attempt has been made to clean the latter blade.
5. A servant brings a caged songbird into any chamber which will host at least one visitor for more than ten minutes. The supposed effect is to calm the nerves of those hearing the bird, but it incidentally redirects attention away from discreet conversation.
6. Each room has a stylised eye painted near the ceiling. In many chambers, one can easily spot the eye, but the eyes are nigh invisible in other chambers.
7. Fresh coats of whitewash cover walls in various rooms, while tarps draped over furniture indicate future decorative projects. Though the servants have taken every effort to air out the house, a lingering acrid smell hangs in the air.
8. A variety of armed stuffed animals decorate the manor house. Two stoats armed with daggers face off against one another, a pair of badgers wield rapiers in a duel and two sparring bears wield sabres.
9. Clear crystal eggs decorate shelves in most of the chambers. However, a servant carelessly—or perhaps purposefully, as a strange prank—placed many of them in precarious positions, where the slightest jostle will knock an egg to the ground where it will shatter.
10. Deep cobwebs fill corners of most of the manor's rooms. Servants dutifully pull down the webs each morning, but they reappear overnight.
11. Vases filled with fresh golden and pink flowers stand on tables or shelves. The flowers have a pleasant aroma but can trigger allergies. A servant begrudgingly removes flowers that trigger an allergic response.
12. Racks of antlers taken from hunted deer and similar creatures adorn the walls near the manor's main entrance. Coats and hats hanging from the antlers invite others to do likewise upon entering the house.
13. One of the servants carrying silverware to the kitchen absentmindedly dropped the forks on the way to his destination. One or two forks lie in random locations in various rooms along his path.
14. Small holes at the base of walls raise suspicions of an infestation of mice. The servants blame the “lazy” cats for not doing their job to eliminate the rodents. A patient person notes a questing nose poking out from one of the holes, just after sunset.
15. Banners embroidered with the family's coat of arms hang from the ceilings in prominent locations around the manor house. Someone has sliced the flags in the dining room with a sword or similarly bladed weapon.
16. Recent downpours caused water to pool on the roof and seep into the ceiling. Irregular brown splotches mar the ceiling on the upper floor, and mould has begun to grow in some places. Servants have placed buckets and bowls below the ceiling where the water has broken through.
17. Woollen “snakes” sit near most of the manor's interior doors. They stop draughts in cooler conditions and do a fair job of muffling conversation. The thick tubes also inflict a nice wallop in a pinch.
18. The wood floor has warped in some places, creating a trip hazard for those unaware of bits of floor sticking up where it shouldn't. When notified, servants gamely attempt to hammer down the offending pieces of wood.
19. In addition to the main dining hall, the manor house offers two informal dining rooms. Multiple round tables fill these smaller dining rooms, allowing for six to sit comfortably or eight with some jostling of elbows. Guests can determine their relative importance based on the frequency they visit the main dining hall.
20. As expected, several hidden passageways connect chambers within the manor house. They merely provide direct, expeditious travel and don't lead to secret areas within the house. Possibly other, well-concealed entrances access otherwise secret locations. 






# NOISOME MARSH 


## CAMPING & CAMPSITES 



1. A reed-fringed knoll rises from the muck to provide a rare dry campsite. A single gnarled tree grows atop the knoll's summit.
2. A sluggishly-flowing channel of muddy water divides a small patch of dry land from the surrounding fens. The water is thigh-high for a human, but deep silt covers the bottom of the channel. Rushes and reeds growly thickly along its banks.
3. A ramshackle hut stands amid a field of large boulders, which are slowly sinking into the mire. The hut still stands —barely—and inquisitive adventurers discover an extensive, but surprisingly partially flooded, cellar below the structure.
4. A dry, reed-fringed swathe of land overlooks a wide, muddy pool. A maddeningly constant—and increasingly cacophonous—chorus of froggy croaking fills the night air, once the sun slips below the horizon. The sound comes from all around the party. (Unwittingly, the heroes have camped in a frog spawning ground, and they are doomed to a sleepless night).
5. A field of tumbled rubble—some pieces of which look suspiciously like carved stone blocks—covers the ground atop a low, tree-fringed hillock. Characters searching the hill find many signs of previous expeditions' campsites. A vaguely triangular-shaped pile of stones hides a set of slippery, slime-covered steps plunging into the bowels of the hill.
6. A jagged chunk of stone about 50 ft. in diameter rises from the noisome swamp. Although moss and lichen cling to the stone's flanks, it is pitted and ridged, making climbing relatively easy. A natural hollow provides shelter from the wind and unfriendly eyes atop the rock. If it has been raining, a small pool of fresh water fills the bottom of the hollow. 





## LOCAL LANDMARKS 



1. A muddy bowl-like dell pierces the fen. Reeds grow thickly along its rim and after heavy rain water cascades into the dell. Locals know the place as the Devil's Bowl and avoid the area after bad weather. A persistent legend tells of a fearsome lizard-like or snake-like creature that dwells underground and emerges to hunt after heavy rain.
2. A muddy ring of standing stones—many leaning at drunken angles or fallen into the muck—surmounts a low hill. The remains of a wooden causeway run to the hill across a series of narrow, mud-filled streams. Reeds, rushes and small trees grow among the stones. A stone lies at the centre of the ring; ancient legends tell of the cultists who cavort here “when the stars are right” and of the strange things they call forth with blood sacrifices from the deep marsh.
3. A vast hawthorn tree grows from the mire. The tree's wide boughs provide an area of deep shade and amid the shadows lurk three partially sunken burial cairns fringed with a great mass of reeds and wildflowers.
4. A single carven obelisk—fully 30 ft. high and 15 ft. in diameter —rears from the mud. Standing perfectly straight it has resisted the mire's downwards pull for centuries untold. Fantastical images of a black dragon, huge lizards and other marsh-dwelling creatures decorate its surface. The Dragon's Pillar—as it is known— was risen long ago by a tribe of marsh-dwelling lizardfolk in veneration of their master. The tribe's degenerate descendants still dwell in the trackless reaches of the deep swamp and occasionally come here.
5. The Grey Fen is a stretch of lifeless, foul-smelling water, avoided by locals and other intelligent swamp dwellers. The fen fills a depression in the wider swamp barely half a mile in diameter. Within, only twisted, warped plants grow and local tales tell of hideously deformed, strangely coloured creatures swimming and wallowing in its slimy waters.
6. Kildrak's Run wends its torturous way through the swamp. This meandering, often narrow but always deep, channel is navigable all along its length. Local stories tell how the insanely murderous dwarf Kildrak the Slayer used the channel to flee after he hunted down and killed several local women he believed to be witches.
7. Tumbled stone blocks, and a wide circle of partly sunken, vine-strangled menhirs, dot and surround the so-called Fetid Fane. This crumbling, lop-sided ruin stands at the end of an opt-flooded, always muddy, sunken processional. Strange sounds emanate from the fane when a gibbous moon hangs low in the nighttime sky, and the site is the subject of many outlandish legends of an elder queen and her queer, froggy subjects doomed to attend her through all eternity.
8. Watcher's Crag rises from the swamp's fetid marsh like a petrified giant. Its rocky, grey flanks perpetually ooze water, and thick growths of moulds, lichens and ferns cling to its vertiginous cliffs. A single, worn and slippery stair hacked from the rock, wends its way around the crag. A ruined tower squats atop the forbidding spire, providing commanding views over the surrounding muck. Travellers often use this place as a relatively dry and safe campsite, although the crag's zenith is all but inaccessible to mounts and the like.
9. Four sickly willow trees with slightly yellowed bark stand about a pool of water fed by three streams wending their way through the surrounding marsh. The trees are known locally as the Four Sisters.
10. A cave mouth—named in elder legend as the Dragon's Maw—pierces the side of a low hill surmounted by a ring of tumbled stones. Weeds and brambles grow thickly atop the hill, and a wide, stone-lined well of ancient aspect cuts deeply into the ground from the hill's zenith.
11. A suspiciously shaped conical hill devoid of all vegetation rises from the mire. In the hill's vicinity, the water is black with peat and vegetation is stunted and illcoloured. Legends speak of a mighty lich dwelling beneath the hill and of the three tunnels leading into its lair. Legends also tell of the scores of adventurers who have sought the hill and who have not returned. Locals call the place, the Hill of Horrors.
12. A wide, low-lying reed-fringed pool lies in an isolated part of the marsh. Nine islands rise above the pool's fetid, stagnant water. Large burial mounds stand atop each island. This was a place sacred to the lizardfolk who dwelt in the marsh long ago. Now a small colony of willo'- wisps linger amid the bones and remnants of the lizardfolk's fallen civilisation. Locals name the place the Pool of Glimmering Bones; all right-minded folk avoid this accursed place. 





## MINOR DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. A flock of marsh birds suddenly take flight from a nearby thicket of reeds and fly away squawking loudly. Seconds later, a loud crashing sound echoes from the same thickets as a large predator pounces moments too late.
2. Flies, gnats and other bothersome marsh-dwelling insects buzz about the party; many of the characters suffer irritating bites and skin rashes as a result.
3. Heavy rain hammers the swamp; as the day wears on, the ground gets boggier and the water level in the swamp's many streams, pools and so on begins to rise, hampering the characters' travel.
4. The clouds clear from in front of the sun, and the temperature rises. The sun's rays glitter upon the innumerable slimy pools and streams scattered across the marsh, possibly temporarily dazzling travellers.
5. Birds swoop low over a section of swamp off to the party's right before landing out of sight behind some rushes. As the party watch, the birds take flight carrying something red and dripping in their beaks.
6. As the party come to a river a series of splashes draws their attention to a jumbled wooden dam. Druids or rangers identify it as an otters' dam. It is sturdy enough to serve as an impromptu means of crossing the river.
7. The sound of crashing and splashing amid a deep thicket of rushes heralds the arrival of a filthy and mudsplattered skinny mongrel dog. At the sight of the characters, the dog hesitantly wags its tail. The dog is starving and easily befriended.
8. Drizzle falls, creating an omnipresent pitter-patter sound. At first almost pleasant, the ubiquity of the sound could quickly become irritating. The drizzle falls for much of the day, making travel wet and miserable.
9. Rustling in the nearby reeds presages the arrival of a small, muddy juvenile boar. Moments later, two more juveniles and their mother crash into view. The mother is extremely (and violently) protective of her babies.
10. Dark clouds hang over the marsh, shrouding the fens in shadow and gloom. Dark shadows gather amid thickets of reeds and under the trees growing along the mire's many streams and rivers. In such weather, the marsh is even more dreary and depressing than usual.
11. Miles ahead, and slightly off the party's line of travel, the smoke of a fire drifts lazily into the air. This could be nothing more than a campfire, the cooking fire of some remote farmstead or something more sinister.
12. When the characters reach a stream or river, they note a half-submerged coracle floating lazily past. A jagged chunk is missing from the coracle's wickerwork hull, and blood covers the surrounding piece of hull. 

## MINOR NIGHTTIME EVENTS 



1. A loud splash, from a noisome pool only 20 or so feet away, echoes through the night air.
2. A gust of strong air blows a pungent bubble of marsh gas over the party. The smell is strong, almost overpowering, but—mercifully—quickly dissipates.
3. Rustling in the undergrowth, and the sound of something squelching through the mud, heralds the approach of some nocturnal predator.
4. A constrictor snake slithers through the fen hunting for dinner. It avoids man-sized or larger creatures but could try to take a dog, halfling or other easy-to-handle prey.
5. A cool nighttime breeze blows across the marsh, stirring the surrounding reeds and rushes into a susurration that could lull a tired guard into a deep sleep.
6. Strangely coloured lights bob in the darkness near the party's camp. If a guard investigates, the lights float away —perhaps leading the inquisitive character into a bog of sucking quicksand-like mud.
7. Light rain falls sporadically during the night, extinguishing the party's campfire and generally making life miserable for those on watch.
8. Moonlight bathes the swamp on this cloudless, cold night. The marsh's pools and ponds reflect the moon's radiance, giving the place an ethereal, ghostly feel.
9. A bubble of noisome swamp gas drifts across the camp enveloping the party in a noxious odour. The gas is harmless but foul-smelling.
10. Bright fire blazes to life, casting lurid shadows over a hill several miles distant. Although initially fierce, the fire quickly lessens, and after an hour or so nothing is left but a faint smouldering glimmer.
11. A deer and her three young suddenly burst into camp. The deers' flanks are heaving as if all four have been running—or perhaps fleeing—for a considerable time. An alert guard isn't surprised by the animals' arrival, but a guard distracted by wine or dozing will likely be startled by their sudden appearance. Whatever is chasing them may—or may not—arrive several rounds later.
12. A random character awakes in the middle of the night to discover they are beset by leaches—their neck and legs are coated with the foul bloodsuckers. The character suffers 1 hit point of damage and must deal with the pernicious bloodsuckers before being able to get back to sleep; the leaches hinder the character's rest, meaning they may not regain hit points, be able to relearn spells and so on. 





## WILDERNESS DRESSING 



1. A wide river flows sluggishly through the mire. An old wooden causeway crosses the channel mere inches above the water. After heavy rain, the causeway is submerged and only a large marker stone at either end betrays its presence.
2. Long bulrushes grow in this stretch of marsh in profusion. The rushes' triangular head—almost eight-foot above the ground—sway softly in the breeze. Paranoid characters may think this is a good place for an ambush.
3. A crudely-crafted spear juts from the mud. Investigation reveals the spear is probably not of human artifice. Several brightly coloured feathers hang from a cord just below the spear's head.
4. A track, bounded by low hedges of rushes and reeds, snakes through the swamp, along a low ridge. Here, the ground is relatively dry and going easy, but the chance of randomly encountering travellers or swamp denizens is doubled.
5. The mouth of a partially flooded cave pierces the side of a low, weed-cloaked hill. A stream winds its way along the hill and pools outside the cave before flowing onwards into the deeper marsh.
6. A fallen tree, thick with lichen and moss, lies across a wide stream, forming a makeshift bridge. A ranger or druid examining the fallen tree can make out clawed footprints imprinted into the moss growing on the tree and in the nearby mud.
7. The remains of a campsite, partially sunken in the mire, overlook a virtually stagnant river. The campsite stands atop a slight rise surrounded by stands of rushes and reeds. Investigation reveals the campsite to be an old one; worryingly, several large rips in the camp's tents suggest a large clawed something tried to get at those sleeping within.
8. Thick mud interspaced with stands of rushes stretches for hundreds of feet before the mud gives way to a wide, sluggishly flowing river.
9. The blackened stump of a once immense tree juts forlornly from the swamp's noisome waters. The tree's exposed roots break through the mud of the low island upon which it stands, looking like great frozen worms or snakes. The blackened stump is 30-foot tall and visible for a mile in all directions.
10. Without warning, the strap on one of the characters' packs snaps dumping the pack's contents into the mire.
11. The rotting remains of a small hut set atop a nearflooded wooden platform lean drunkenly over a reed-fringed pool of surprisingly clear water. The prow of a sunken rowboat juts from the water near the platform. The rowboat has a small hole below the waterline but is otherwise serviceable.
12. A slime-covered statue lies facedown amid the noisome swamp's muck. The statue is man-sized and difficult to prise from the cloying mud. If the characters manage the feat, they discover the statue is a surprisingly lifelike depiction of a man with a look of ultimate horror upon his face. So lifelike is the carving that it hints at the subject's insanity or terror…
13. A swath of colourful wildflowers grows amid the fetid mire. The flowers carpet the ground, but close examination reveals the ground to have the consistency of quicksand. To walk among the flowers invites death.
14. An upturned, and rotting, rowboat lies on the banks of a wide river. One of the boat's oars is tangled in the lowhanging branches of a nearby weeping willow.
15. The partially sunken skeletal remains of a humanoid lie tangled among the weeds and reeds bounding a placid pool. The remains could be those of a lizardfolk, other swamp denizen or traveller.
16. Footprints—slowly filling with boggy water—cross the characters' path. A tracker can determine that whoever left the tracks was here mere minutes ago.
17. A small stone marker, replete with a chiselled arrow pointing to the west, is rendered almost invisible by a thick stand of weeds and creepers.
18. A huge tree stands hard against a stagnant pool of muddy water. The tree's twisted, grasping roots break the surface of a muddy bank before growing into the pool itself.
19. The remains of a shattered wagon lie incongruously over several sunken boulders. Investigation reveals it looks like the wagon was dropped from a great height, and has not been here that long.
20. The buzzing of many insects comes from a thicket of reeds. Characters investigating the sound discover the rotting, disembowelled corpse of a lizardfolk. 





## UNEVENTFUL TRAVEL 



1. The weather is overcast all day, and toward evening light rain falls over the swamp. The pitter-patter of rain obscures much of the normal marsh sounds the characters have become accustomed to hearing. The sound could also lull tired characters—and perhaps their guards—into a deep sleep.
2. All morning, the party ford a series of shallow muddy streams, cutting through the mire. Weeping willows and the like cast their wide branches over the streams, creating many shadowy places for ambushers to lurk. Once the sun reaches its zenith, the party reach higher— dryer—ground.
3. At dawn, a thin mist hangs over the marsh, giving the place an ethereal, otherworldly feel. The mist burns off after a few hours and the day is hot and dry. As the party penetrate deeper into the fetid marsh, the terrain becomes more unforgiving, and the dryer places fewer and farther between.
4. The morning's weather is typical of the season, but by early afternoon thick, dreary clouds hang low in the sky threatening a heavy and sustained downpour. Such a deluge begins just after the party stop for the day.
5. The party do little all day but slog through thick, glutinous mud and thickets of grasping reeds. In places, the reeds are so high, the characters temporarily lose sight of each other as they push onwards.
6. The day is uneventful, and the characters see no other travellers in the marsh. Around midday, they reach a large pool—or perhaps a small lake. The water is shallow and a flock of wading birds regards the characters as they pass.
7. Although the party must battle through swaths of dark, glutinous mud for much of the morning, they reach a section of higher ground later in the day which provides much easier going. Toward the end of the day, they discover a suitable campsite. (Roll on “Camping & Campsites” to determine the campsite's characteristics).
8. The day dawns dry and bright. Birds, and their song, fill the air, which seems fresher than usual for the noisome swamp. The sun rises high in the sky, and the day is a pleasant one. Although the characters slog through the mire for a whole day, they encounter no other travellers or large predators. Light clouds gather, at dusk.
9. The characters stumble upon a raised, dry track wending its way through the mire which uses the contours of a low ridge to avoid the worst of the bog. Signs of other travellers are plentiful in the soft, but not boggy, ground, and the characters make good time. (Such an area is a good place for the characters to meet other travellers if the party is in need of assistance or information.)
10. A dull day's travel through the monotonous mire is only broken by the occasional cloud of biting insects attracted to the party's sweat. The ground is squelchy but relatively firm, and although everyone ends the day tied and muddy nothing untoward befalls the party this day.
11. The morning's travel is stop-start as the characters find their way over or around a dozen streams flowing through the boggy, low-lying ground. Sometimes the streams are narrow enough to jump across while in other spots sodden causeways or fallen trees serve as primitive bridges. The party sees no one all day (although—obviously—someone must have had a good reason to build the causeways).
12. Heavy rain pummels the marsh, halving visibility and soaking travellers to the skin. It quickly becomes evident that travel in such conditions—particularly as water levels begin to rise—is impossible. The party is best-advised to find a relatively dry spot to wait out the rain. 





# NOISOME SEWER 


## FOLK TO ENCOUNTER 



1. Sakari (N male human): Scrawny and clad in rags, Sakari is homeless and lives in the sewers. He scavenges amid the muck and the murk for things to sell to the scrap collectors and more desperate traders. A decent man, Sakari was once a man of note, but disastrous business decisions and a malevolent wife have consigned him to this horrible place. Pathetically grateful for any kindness the characters offer him, Sakari is a useful ally—he has contacts among many of the beggars and sewermen.
2. Ergoth (NE old male half-orc fighter 2): Recently beaten by two off-duty soldiers, Ergoth has retreated to the sewers to nurse his wounds and plot his revenge. As a half-orc, he is at home in the dark and knows the surrounding tunnels well. Now an old man, hate consumes Ergoth. He takes what he can get and gives little—if anything—in return.
3. Elena (CN female human thief 4): A skilled cat burglar, Elena has taken to hiding her ill-gotten gains in the sewer. Blessed with no sense of smell, she doesn't notice the stench. She wears dirty leather armour and keeps her hair tightly wound under a soft leather cap. She prefers to avoid combat and watches the characters from afar. If they get close to one of her caches she emerges from the gloom to distract them.
4. Morcaer (N male human): Morcaer hates his new job; however, trouble with a local merchant has meant this is the only position he could find. Clad in thick leather trousers and wearing a scarf drenched in cheap perfume wound around his face, to keep the stench at bay, he suddenly emerges from the gloom. Muttering to himself, he doesn't notice the characters until he literally bumps into them.
5. Ordgar (LN male human): An old-hand at working in the sewer, Ordgar knows the surrounding tunnels well and even knows where thieves and other undesirables congregate. Unshaven and grimy, Ordgar cuts an uncouth figure. A borderline alcoholic, drink features heavily in any conversation he has with the characters.
6. Saewyn (N female human fighter 2): Saewyn doesn't yet know she is a wererat. Last night she remembers staggering home from the tavern but has no idea how she ended up in the sewers. She's lost her favourite cloak and reeks of the sewer (clearly she fell in something while drunk). She has a dried cut on her forehead, and blood mats her short black hair. She has a pounding headache. Saewyn would love help getting out of the sewer and could become a reoccurring, but perhaps, problematic, ally.
7. Viljo (N male human): Viljo suffers from leprosy and has retreated to the sewers to escape the abuse of the citizens. The disease has ravaged his body, and his face has particularly suffered; much of his nose has wasted away. Viljo is in tremendous pain and hasn't eaten for two days. He is miserable and accepts any help offered. He knows the sewers well and will exchange his knowledge for food or healing.
8. Heimo (CN male human thief 3): When the characters encounter, Heimo—a weasel-faced, balding man—he is on the way to a secret rendezvous to discuss his next burglary. He is cagey about his reasons for being in the sewer and can't wait to take his leave. If the characters persist in questioning him, his persistent stutter manifests itself, making him look even more guilty of some nefarious doing.
9. Saull (CE male human thief 1): Saull has survived on— and under—the streets for five years after his parents died in a horrible carting accident. Surviving on the charity of others and his wits, he has grown up cold and hard. Immediately sizing up the characters, his goal is to get as much out of them as possible while giving as little as possible in return. He hams up his horrible circumstances and plays on the emotions of anyone who seems even vaguely sympathetic.
10. Kaari Ojanen (CE female human vampire): In Kaari Ojanen the characters have encountered one of the most dangerous sewer denizens. A vampire newly arrived in town, Kaari is scouting the sewers as both a hunting ground and means of escape should the sun's accursed rays trap her away from home. She is not interested in fighting the characters and instead masquerades as a servant sent into the sewer to search for her lady's lost trinket. She spins a fanciful tale of her evil mistress but flees if the characters become suspicious. Unless given no choice, she does not use her vampiric powers in front of the characters; she has only just arrived in town after fleeing her last home—she has no desire to move on again just yet. 





## MINOR EVENTS 



1. A loud rumbling from above the ceiling breaks the quiet. It seems to head along the sewer before fading away. (A heavily laden cart has just rolled along the street above).
2. A muted splash of something—or perhaps someone— falling into the water sounds from a random direction.
3. A loud splash caused by something falling into the sewer from a random direction breaks the quiet. A minute later, ripples reach the party's position.
4. The air grows rank with the stench of decay and excrement. Weak-stomached explorers may become violently sick as a result.
5. Splinters of wood—perhaps the remains of a makeshift raft—float past the party, spinning gently in the current.
6. The mouldering remains of a decomposing dog float passed the party, before gently coming to rest against the walkway slightly further down the passageway.
7. A thick glob of slime—dislodged by the party's passage— falls from the ceiling onto one of the characters' heads. The slime is nothing more than slime, but its greenish colour could cause minor panic…
8. The indistinct sound of singing reaches the characters' ears. The faint sound echoes through the sewer making determining where it came from impossible.
9. A foaming wave of excrement flows down the sewer. Powerful ripples precede the wave, giving explorers almost a minute's warning.
10. A thick miasma hangs in the air. Tendrils of a fog-like vapour rise from the fetid waters and provide concealment to anything more than 20 ft. away. The smell here is terrible.
11. If the party possesses any mundane light sources, their flames suddenly turn blue as they encounter a pocket of flammable gas. If the characters do not quickly retreat or extinguish their naked flames, there is a loud explosion.
12. Bats nest on the ceiling. Bright lights disturb them and they flap about screeching until the intruders leave. In the confusion, the bats might extinguish one or more of the party's lights or knock an explorer into the filth of the sewer's channel.
13. The squeaking of many rats emerges from the darkness ahead. Rats infest this stretch of the sewers and the party are about to invade their home. The rats—normal rats, not their more dangerous giant brethren—are scared of the characters and avoid them if given the chance. Signs of their presence: gnawed bones, piles of droppings and so on—are everywhere.
14. A distant scream echoes through the sewer. It is suddenly cut off and is not repeated.
15. The party catches the faint flicker of torchlight from a side tunnel. Investigations reveal a pair of filthy sewer men cleaning a blockage. They haven't seen anyone else since starting work.
16. A congealed floating island of muck and debris floats past the characters. A giant rat, its glimmering eyes glaring at the party, perches atop the island. If attacked, the rat dives into the water.
17. A fragment of the walkway suddenly gives way under a character's feet. Only quick reactions save the character from tumbling into the sewer's fetid water.
18. The pungent stench of rotting vegetables foreshadows the characters' discovery of a heaped pile of slimy, rotting vegetables.
19. A sudden wind issues through the sewer, blowing the stench of excrement and urine into the characters' faces.
20. If the characters have a mundane light source it suddenly—and inexplicably—goes out. 





## SEWER DRESSING 



1. Ahead, the bricks lining the sewer wall have fallen, creating a tumbled pile of slippery rubble blocking the walkway. (The rubble is unstable; unwary characters will likely slip and fall into the sewer channel.)
2. Here the sewer channel narrows and the walkway correspondingly widens. Someone has bridged the channel with a thick, but rotten, wooden plank. A rusting iron spike is driven into each end, nailing it in place.
3. The stench of excrement, urine and rot is particularly strong in this area.
4. A wooden lantern lies on its side amid the filth coating the walkway. Its oil has leaked out, creating a particularly slippery area. The lantern is still vaguely warm to the touch, suggesting someone passed this way recently.
5. This section of the walkway has crumbled away leaving a five-foot-wide gap explorers must traverse to continue. The rubble from the walkway fills the sewer channel creating a dam of sorts. After excessively heavy rain, the water level rises here inundating the walkway.
6. A single mouldy knee-high leather boot stands incongruously amid the muck. The white glint of bone and the smell of moulding flesh emerges from within. Investigations reveal the unfortunate boot wearer's leg was severed just below the knee. Of the rest of the body, there is no sign.
7. A crudely scratched sigil decorates one wall. It comprises three pips with an arrow over the last pip. (The sigil is a code used by the local thieves' guild; it tells members that a secret exit to the streets is hidden in the third passageway ahead).
8. The mouldering remains of a dead cat lie on the walkway. By the looks of things, its back was broken.
9. The murmur of voices is discernible to sharp-eared characters. Investigation reveals the voices come from behind the wall, but there is no apparent secret door here. (The sewer channel shares a wall with the cellar of the building above).
10. Part of the ceiling has collapsed, dumping bricks and rubble into the sewer channel. The blockage has formed a dam, and the “water” level is higher behind it. Dextrous explorers can use it to cross the channel. Those slipping and falling dislodge a crucial stone in the dam, causing the entire thing to collapse.
11. Greenish/brown slime coats the walkway. Footsteps are clearly visible in the muck heading in the opposite direction to the party's direction of travel.
12. A niche carved into the sewer wall holds a broken, rusting lantern.
13. A rusting metal grill protects a narrow chute joining the main channel at a steep downward angle. The dry passage beyond the chute is barely three-foot wide.
14. Water oozes through the crumbling bricks in the ceiling before dripping into the sewer. From a distance, the water's soft pitter-patter sounds like rain. The walkways here are particularly slick.
15. A broken grate hangs from one wall, attached by only a few thick rusting pins driven deep into the wall. The gate is wide enough to block the walkway but is not strong enough to stop any determined explorer. Its twin on the opposite walkway is in much better condition.
16. A strange, wide track in the muck suggests something large, like a snake, slithered through here recently.
17. A mouldering, slime-covered rat corpse lies on a ledge. Both its eyes are missing and its tail has been partially chewed off.
18. A slimy island of excrement and mud partially blocks the sewer channel. Anyone standing on the island discovers —rapidly—its consistency is that of quicksand.
19. Faded and smeared chalk sigils decorate this wall; they are now illegible.
20. A glimmer of light comes from up ahead. When the party reaches the light, they discover a narrow hole in the ceiling that enables a thin beam of sunlight to reach into the sewers. The air here is a little clearer and the sounds of the street clearly filter down into the gloom. 





## MINOR LOCALES OF INTEREST 



1. Several sewer passageways come together in a rough cross. The flow of so much turgid water has eroded the bottom of the intersection, and now a lazy but powerful whirlpool draws the waters into yet deeper caverns.
2. An iron-bound door pierces one wall. The portal is old, swollen and hard to open. It is also barred from the inside—clearly someone values their privacy.
3. This sewer passageway is old and decayed. Part of one wall has fallen away creating a rubble field. Characters exploring the collapsed wall discover a small, dry natural space beyond. The foundations of a large building intersect the area.
4. A great mass of rubbish and detritus has formed a veritable island almost completely blocking the flow of water through this sewer channel. Tracks of tiny creatures— probably rats—are visible in the island's “mud”.
5. The characters hear tumbling water from quite some distance away before they reach this area. Here, the sewer channel drops five-foot over a weir. Crude steps cut into both walkways drop the, down a similar height.
6. In several places, the walkway in this section of sewer has crumbled away. Long , slippery — and possibly rotten—boards bridge the resulting gaps.
7. The sewer channel flows through the middle of a natural cave. Most of the cave is unworked and in its natural state ; however, some effort has been made to smooth the floor adjacent to the channel.
8. For a 30-foot stretch of channel, the ceiling is twice the usual height (50% chance) or so low the characters— except gnomes and halflings—must crouch or bash their heads on the brickwork (50% chance).
9. The water flow noticeably increases as it approaches this area. Here, the sewer was dug over a natural cavern network. The remorseless flow of water has broken through into the caverns, flooding them. A waterfall drops into the cavern below; only a trickle of water makes it passed the waterfall into the sewer beyond.
10. A shallow ramp—wide enough for a cart—leads up from this section of sewer. It leads to a grimy, iron-bound double door. Beyond lies the redolent basement of a tanner. Tracks in the sludge show a cart has traversed the slope relatively recently. 





## DISCARDED OR LOST THINGS 



1. Incongruously, a fine red cloak with a fox fur collar is carefully folded and wedged into a small niche in the wall. Its hem is dirty, but otherwise, it is in good repair (and worth 3 gp).
2. A small niche in the wall holds a small parcel wrapped in sailcloth. The package contains three torches, flint and steel and a dagger. The sailcloth has protected the objects from the environment; they are all dry and in good condition.
3. The tip of a rusting, bent dagger is wedged between two bricks comprising the sewer wall. The weapon has clearly been here for some considerable time.
4. A partially sunken sack floats amongst the effluent, in the centre of the channel. The sack still holds 3 sp and 1 gp wrapped in its sodden, noisome folds.
5. A shuttered lantern, with about one hour's fuel left inside, stands wedged against the wall on the opposite walkway. Its shutter is closed; only a faint glow radiates from the lantern.
6. A long wooden rake is lent against one wall. Its wellworn handle is wrapped with leather strips.
7. A pile of fresh bricks stands neatly stacked next to a section of crumbled wall. A trowel, chisels and other mason's equipment sits nearby ready for use.
8. An empty wine flask hangs by a leather strap from a protruding brick in the wall. When the characters arrive, a rat has climbed the wall and is sniffing at the pouch. When it senses the characters, it leaps down and flees.
9. A slimy short sword—its tip stained with dried blood—lies on the floor.
10. A bloody, sodden bandage hangs off the edge of the slick walkway.
11. A haphazard pile of items pulled from the sewer— including soggy, ragged clothes, bits of wood and other things—blocks the walkway. A rake leans against the wall.
12. The mouldering skeleton of a long reptile—a constrictor snake—lies stretched out on the walkway. A spear has been driven through its skull, pinning it to the ground.
13. A tiny burial cairn comprising bricks pulled from the wall partially blocks the walkway. Explorers taking the cairn apart discover the decomposing corpse of a monstrous rat buried within.
14. Incongruously, a pile of neatly folded clothing perches next to the noisome sewerage channel. It looks for all the world like someone has gone swimming! The clothes comprise fine black trousers, a silk shirt and a short cape along with a pair of knee-high gentleman's boots.
15. A ten-foot-long pole with a curved hook on one end lies discarded on the floor. The hook's inner surface is worn, suggesting it has seen much use.
16. A small, leafless tree branch lies entangled amid the effluent. Perceptive characters notice the glimmer of silver from around the wood—a small silver necklace (worth 50 gp) is entwined around the branch. While retrieving the necklace, a careless character could tumble into the sewer.
17. A small sodden pouch lies on the floor in the shadows. The pouch holds 5 gp and a crude map of the surrounding tunnels showing two exits to the streets.
18. A small bundle of possessions lies on the floor. Splatters of blood decorate the surrounding brickwork. The items comprise a small sack, a change of (dirty) clothes and a bedroll along with some scraps of mouldering food.
19. A rope dangles down from a spike hammered into the ceiling over the sewer channel. The spike pierces the ceiling near the underside of a steel trap door. The rope reaches down to just above the current “water” level.
20. A 12-foot-long, three-foot-wide raft—comprising two doors nailed together is tied to a shard of stone protruding from the side of the walkway. The raft is sturdy enough—unless more than 200 lbs. is piled on top. However, there are no paddles. 





# OCEAN VOYAGE 


## PASSENGERS 



1. Hild Eddols (N female human): Loud and large, Hild speaks precisely and at great length if given a chance. That, combined with a large head of curly brown hair, makes her easily identifiable even at a decent distance. She habitually wears black clothing. Deep down she is lonely and grabs any opportunity to make a friend.
2. Praen Osmer (NE middle-aged male human): Slender and well dressed, Praen cares only for himself. Always seemingly with his head buried in a book, he is a voracious reader. During the voyage, he'll approach the characters to see if he can borrow a book (or two). Unless the characters remind him, he'll “forget” to return it before he disembarks.
3. Panu Ahokas (CN old male human): Old, scruffily dressed and seemingly perpetually slightly confused, Panu creates chaos and confusion wherever he goes. He is also hard of hearing which adds to the frustration many people feel when dealing with him. Panu has a habit of wandering the deck muttering to himself. Sometimes he tries to coax seabirds to land on his outstretched arm.
4. Kadal (NE middle-aged male human thief 2) Kadal looks older than he should; worry lines crease his face, and his red nose seems almost comically oversized. Rarely seen without a drink in his hand, Kadal is an alcoholic thief whose luck has finally changed. He's just pulled off the heist of his life and is fleeing to a distant land with 200 gp in his baggage to live out his retirement. During the voyage, he celebrates his good fortune. A lot.
5. Aelliah Cyelrae (LG female half-elf): This middle-aged woman wears her long black hair tied back in a bun. Although she seems cheerful, the lines on her face radiate fatigue. The reason for her exhaustion is evident; she carries a baby in a sling across her chest. The baby is restless and spends a lot of time crying, which causes mounting tension as the voyage drags on—particularly during the night when others are trying to sleep.
6. Haefoc Isgar (N male human fighter 5): This young man sports an impressively rakish moustache which is his pride and joy. Never seen without it waxed and styled, Haefoc is wildly vain. Well-to-do and slightly full of himself, he deems almost everyone to be his social inferior. He is not a popular man and can take offence at the smallest thing. Unfortunately, Haefoc is a skilled duellist, and if he feels his honour is besmirched, he'll challenge the offending character to a duel (to first blood). Most of the sailors avoid him.
7. Fardulf Chellas (CG male human fighter 2): Although otherwise fit and healthy, Fardulf needs the use of a walking stick to hobble about on account of his deformed left leg. He maintains he was born with the deformity, but perceptive characters may suspect he is lying. In reality, he is suffering the debilitating effects of a pernicious curse put upon him by a spurned lover. Fardulf believes if he gets far enough away from her the curse will fade.
8. Otgar Nihiel (N male human cleric 3): With a beard as wild and unruly as an untended rhododendron bush, at first glance, Otgar looks to be a freakishly tall dwarf. A devotee of the sea god, Otgar is always voyaging on one ship or another. Captains offer him free passage in exchange for his prayers for calm seas and a good wind. He leads a service every morning to his lord; all are welcome to attend.
9. Duluali Aldarrae (CG female elf magic-user 3): Swathed in a thick cloak and with a hat pulled down low over her face, Duluali is deeply uncomfortable at sea. The constant motion of the waves and the utter lack of any vegetation deeply disturbs her, and she is miserable. However, this voyage is necessary for her research; a sage in a distant land has a copy of a particularly rare book she wishes to study. Of the book's identity, she will not speak.
10. Semni Edfu (LE male human fighter 3): A mercenary bodyguard, Semni is once again searching for a new employer after a series of misunderstandings over the exact wording of his most recent contract. He tells anyone listening, at great length, it is not his fault his employer didn't understand the agreement and goes on and on about his personal honour and how his word is his bond. Ruggedly handsome with short black hair and brooding eyes he is a bit of a lady's man. He prides himself on never lying, but sometimes what he does not say is as eloquent as what he does say. 





## STOWAWAYS 



1. Baelulam Koehelvar (CN female half-elf fighter 1): Hiding deep in the cargo hold, Baelulam only emerges at night to scavenge for food. Several people have seen her, but in the dim light below decks, none have realised she is not meant to be on-board. Cleverly, she has cut her hair short to ape the appearance of a typical crewman and wears rough leathers of the sort sailors wear. Her success thus far has bolstered her confidence; soon she plans to raid the galley for a feast! If caught, she refuses to divulge why she has stowed away.
2. Erfael Neblor (N male gnome illusionist 2): Erfael is on a Grand Adventure. While he has a decent amount of coin, he thought it would be more fun to hide in the hold and see if he can remain hidden for the entire voyage. Of course, he has got bored of late and is using his illusions to break the monotony. Thus, while he is around things literally go bump in the night, and strange shadows linger in certain parts of the ship. Cloaked in invisibility, he emerges at night to take the evening air and to scavenge food and drink. The crew have noticed several things have gone missing, and the strange sounds have given rise among the sailors to mutterings of spectral beings haunting the ship.
3. Konal (N young male human): Konal is on-board because of one of the characters. He's hero-worshipped the character from afar since he heard of the group's exploits and dreams of becoming a powerful and famous adventurer. Before stowing aboard, he equipped himself for “adventure” with a backpack containing spare clothes along with other odds and ends, a buckler and two daggers. He's decided to pledge his allegiance to his hero once the ship is far e n o u g h away from l a n d . U n f o r t u n a t e l y , although he is thin a n d w i r y Konal has a prodigious a p p e t i t e a n d h a s run out of food. Consequently, hunger forces him from hiding sooner than he would like.
4. Anhuri Buto (CN young female human): Wild and capricious, this 16-year-old ran away from home after a blazing row with her parents. Anhuri hasn't thought things through and while furious with her parents has just realised she has no idea where this ship is going. Although well-dressed, she has very little money.
5. Giso (NG female human thief 1): A petty thief, Giso is fleeing a powerful enemy. She recently picked the pocket of an important individual and has in her possession a scroll that its owner would kill to retrieve. (Before she stowed aboard, she survived one “accident” and one mugging that turned into attempted murder). Giso has short dark hair and a playful smile. She tries to hide her troubles behind laughs and jokes, but perceptive characters may notice she isn't telling them the whole truth.
6. Jamir Keenear (NE male halfling fighter 1/thief 1): Jamir was a pirate until recently. The only survivor of a vicious sea battle, he had been in the water for several days clinging to wreckage when he spotted the characters' ship. He climbed aboard during the night and has been hiding ever since. His friendly dark brown eyes and guileless face hide a malevolence that would shock the most depraved goblin or orc. If caught, he plays on his race's reputation for hospitality while plotting theft and murder. When the ship reaches port, he steals whatever he can before fleeing. 





## SAILORS 



1. Azthur Kildann (NG male dwarf fighter 2): Azthur never seems to feel the cold; he rarely wears more than a ragged pair of cut-off trousers. His chest is impressively furry—secretly, he is proud of this as it showcases his “boundless virility”—and sometimes it seems his beard and chest hair are one and the same. An oddity for a dwarf, Azthur loves the sea. He is a skilled carpenter.
2. Agler (LN male human fighter 1): Agler has a pet mongrel dog, “hilariously” called Dogon. They are devoted to one another, and the dog goes everywhere (except into the rigging) with his master. The rest of the crew also love Dogon, who has grown fat on their titbits. Agler himself is a cheery, happy-go-lucky fellow. He does not realise that Dogon's name is blasphemy to the mad cultists of Dagon, Shadow in the Sea. Even more worryingly, one of the newly recruited crew, Sangasu, worships that fell power and is plotting to hurl the dog overboard as a sacrifice once he can get the accursed beast alone.
3. Sangasu Girsu (CE male human fighter 1/thief 2): A devotee of Dagon, Sangasu has come aboard specifically to sacrifice Dogon to his insane master. A competent sailor, he has yet to fit in with the crew—who find his humour off-putting. Perceptive characters might notice Sangasu's appearance is a little strange— essentially hairless, he is extremely sensitive to bright light. He is happiest in the bilges, pumping out the water. In a shadowy corner of the bilge, he has set up a small shrine to his demonic master. If confronted with proof of his vile practices he jumps into the sea, confident his master will save him. He won't.
4. Meania Apisala (NG female human fighter 1): Meania loves the sea. Enraptured by its endless, shifting beauty, she composes long poems and songs about life on and below the ocean waves. She has a beautiful singing voice, but her compositions are not as polished as she would like. If the party includes a bard, she badgers them for songwriting tips.
5. Egino Chali (NG middle-aged male human fighter 1): Beset with a seemingly permanent squint, Egino looks to be in constant pain. Almost blind, he tries to hide his impairment from the rest of the crew, although they all well-know his inability to see anything beyond arm's length. A friendly chap, Egino believes he is too old to be scampering about the rigging anymore and wants to become first mate.
6. Heva Dol (N female human fighter 1): Strong, but slightly plump, Heva is a skilled sailor and navigator. Fascinated by the stars, she often volunteers for the night watch (which makes her popular with the rest of the crew). Diligent in her duties, she both keeps watch and draws detailed sketches of the night sky. She is a skilled artist and has a book filled with her drawings. Recently, a slight change in one of the constellations has intrigued (and worried) her.
7. Hardrad Omer (LN old male human): Hardrad is far too old to be a sailor. He's been at sea man and boy and doesn't know any other life. He clings to his position onboard due to his prodigious skill in splicing ropes, mending sails and tying all manner of knots. He's found on deck puttering through his day's tasks and never ventures into the rigging. Hardrad is virtually bald and his skin is weatherworn and wrinkled.
8. Ima Ubi (CN female human thief 1): Obsessed with tales of the sea and the many creatures lurking in its depth, Ima is superstitious and often on edge. She permanently worries some vast underwater creature will emerge to drag the ship down to a watery grave. Recently, she's been dreaming dark dreams of glistening, coiled tentacles stirring in the depths. Ima is incredibly impressionable and has been subliminally affected by Sangasu's (see #3) prayers to Dagon.
9. Gislin Taetel (CN male human thief 2): Rail thin, Gislin has a prodigious appetite and can often be found trying to wrangle extra food from the galley. While not lurking below decks, he does as little work as possible and has a reputation among the crew as a work-shy skiver. When the ship reaches port, the captain plans to dismiss him.
10. Myvainir Shakirae (CG male elf fighter 2/magic-user 1): A rarity among the crew, Myvainir fell in love with the sea when he saw it for the first time a decade ago. Since then, he's worked on a variety of ships. His goal is to sail every sea and ocean and to explore as much of the world as possible. Like many of his kind, he has almost unending patience and plans to spend the next 50-100 years doing just that. If the party plans future voyages to far-off places, he might well join them! 





## SHIP' S DRESSING 



1. A sailor has left a tangled mass of wet rope dangerously uncoiled on the deck. Unwary passengers could trip and fall as a result.
2. Wet footprints mar the deck. They lead from the rail toward the ship's stern and to one of the hatches leading below decks. A close look at the footprints suggests that whoever made them was probably not human.
3. A bucket, half full of seawater, stands on the deck against the rail. A wet rag lies nearby. There is no sign, of the sailor meant to be washing the deck.
4. A character spots strange scratches in the deck partially hidden by a barrel. Investigations reveal what looks like a treasure map carved into the wood. Maddeningly, the map bears no names, but a sea-wise sailor might recognise a certain cluster of oddly-shaped islands.
5. The ship's deck is in excellent condition. Spotlessly clean, it is washed down every morning by the crew.
6. The ship's sails have seen better days; they are patched in several places and show signs of many repairs.
7. During the night, the hull springs a minor leak. The next morning, several crew members are hung over the side to aid in effecting repairs. The work takes much of the day, and while it is completed the captain orders the ship's sails furled to lessen stress on the hull.
8. Several pennants fly from the ship's mast. Perceptive characters notice the flags change design most days. It transpires the captain is superstitious and commands the pennants adjusted based on the weather, the ship's location, direction of travel and which oceanic power he is trying to appease. He has a complicated system that not even the first mate understands.
9. During the voyage, the captain has the crew start on a program of maintenance. The first thing they do is paint the ship's rail a bright, jaunty yellow colour.
10. The crew has a strange tradition; every new member must carve his name into the ship's mast. Deceased or lost hands have their names effaced to avoid bad luck falling on the vessel. A surprising number of names have been scratched out, and the remaining names ascend the mast for quite some distance.
11. Sawdust and wood shavings litter one part of the deck. Scattered among them lie the ship's carpenter's tools.
12. A perceptive character discovers an empty wineskin stuffed behind a badly coiled rope on deck. If the character uncorks the wineskin, he detects the scent of wine; clearly, it has been drunk recently—perhaps during last night's watch!
13. Beautiful carvings of dense underwater forests teeming with fish decorate the doors leading to the captain's and passengers' cabins. Perceptive observers detect the hint of long, sinuous tentacles in several of the carvings.
14. The vessel's portholes feature double shutters akin to storm shutters. If questioned about this, the crew relate the captain had them installed after the ship nearly sunk in a heavy sea which saw some of the cabins flooded.
15. A pirate attack is a particular nightmare of the ship's captain. Thus, he has installed weapon lockers in several places on deck containing heavy crossbows plentifully supplied with bolts. Similarly, he requires every member of the crew is armed at all times.
16. The vessel has two rowboats securely lashed down on deck protected with storm covers. Each is supplied with a small barrel of water and a week's hardtack biscuits for six passengers. Sometimes amorous crew members or passengers sneak into the rowboats for some privacy.
17. Three empty barrels are lined up on deck ready for cleaning. The crewman overseeing the work has forgotten to secure the barrels; they might fall over, roll about the deck and injure an unsuspecting passenger.
18. The ship's mascot—a ragged parrot—has got a taste for wine. Often grumpy and hungover in the mornings—the crew think it is funny to get him drunk—he perches on a rat line looking glum and tired.
19. Barnacles coat the hull, below the waterline. The growths are visible from time to time, as the ship breaks through the waves. When the ship encounters calm weather, the captain sends crew members down on nets to scrape them off.
20. The ladders linking the ship's various decks are particularly steep. Unwary passengers or those using the ladders in high seas have a greater than normal chance of slipping and falling. 





## SHIPBOARD SIGHTS & SOUNDS 



1. The insistent cawing of the seabirds wheeling and diving overhead fills the air. Anyone eating on deck is constantly dive-bombed by hungry birds.
2. A huge bird—perhaps an albatross or something more “exotic”—soars high overhead. It takes no note of the vessel as it continues on its lonely course.
3. A smudge of dark clouds hangs on the horizon for much of the day. When he descends, the lookout from the crow's-nest speaks of gloomy shadows on the surface of the ocean. The next day, the clouds have disappeared.
4. A sudden loud thud speaks of something large and heavy striking the ship's hull below the waterline. Of what struck the vessel there is no sign, but the event puts some of the sailors—a superstitious lot—on edge for the rest of the day.
5. Rats infest the ship's bilges. Driven forth by hunger, several of the creatures scamper about the deck in search of food. If chased, they flee seeking hiding places in one of the ship's uncountable nooks and crannies.
6. A ship under full sail appears on the horizon late in the afternoon. In the morning, it is no longer visible.
7. Sailors clamber about the rigging. One starts singing a sea shanty telling of the epic tale of Vilimzair Aralivar's legendary voyages. (Vilimzair was a bard of puissant skill who fell into the clutches of pirates. He endured many hardships before he wrested control of the vessel from the pirate captain.)
8. Some of the other passengers get into a loud argument about sleeping arrangements—some want to swap berths, but the others decline. Investigations reveal they all believe the berths of the first group to be haunted!
9. Loud voices from below decks speak of a sudden, angry argument. Characters eavesdropping discover one of the sailors has just surprised and captured a stowaway! (See “Stowaways with Personality”.)
10. A sudden strong wind picks up, filling the ship's sails. The ship runs before the wind, making good time, but several of the passengers fall seasick, much to the crew's endless amusement.
11. Several passengers stroll about the deck around midday to both take the air and to gossip. One blunders into the way of the sailors going about their business, causing a minor accident.
12. A few off-duty members of the crew sit by the rail idly fishing and chatting. They are doing quite well—they have already half-filled their bucket with fish destined for the galley.
13. Off-duty crewmen sit about playing a simple dice game, to pass the time. They are gambling for a combination of small stakes and choice jobs in the upcoming days. They welcome the chance to take money from a passenger, but cannot afford to lose the kind of money an adventurer could throw around.
14. The ship sails through a heavy swell. Waves break over the bow; quickly the spray soaks everyone on deck. The wind picks up, and for the rest of the day, the weather is best described as inclement.
15. A scream from above presages a sailor falling from the rigging. The unfortunate man misses the deck but falls into the water. The rest of the crew rushes to help him before he is lost to a watery grave.
16. The ship sails through a small patch of debris: broken spars, pieces of decking and a sodden mass of sail float seemingly serenely on the gentle swell. What caused the ship to sink is a mystery.
17. A shout from the rigging and a sailor pointing insistently off to starboard warns the ship's company of something in the water. Perceptive characters spot a huge black shadow gliding beneath the waves. It passes below the ship without incident.
18. Three sailors sit about the deck repairing a torn sail. As they do so, they talk among themselves and occasionally break into a sea shanty. They are bored and welcome any diversion.
19. A sailor comes up from the galley with a bucket of rubbish. She unceremoniously hurls the contents over the side, before returning below decks.
20. The sound of someone playing a jaunty tune on a flute wafts up from below decks. The music continues for several minutes before tailing off. 





# ON THE ROAD 



## HIGHWAYS & BYWAYS 



1. This fine road sees heavy traffic, and its value is reflected in its construction. Stone pavers keep travel smooth and mud to a minimum. Along the sides of the road, wooden posts mark the miles to the nearest major city or, for those who know the area, to the nearest inn or hostel. Wide grassy strips along the roadside give clear sight lines to help deter bandits, offer a place for cattle and steeds to graze or enable slower travellers to give way to those moving at speed.
2. If the pungent smell of cow dung weren't enough to give it away, twin ruts on this grassy road reveal its most frequent users: farmers and herders driving their wares to market. Cutting through the countryside, the road meanders through wide open fields, high grasses waving in the wind. Only the occasional farmhouse and barn, or telltale sign of chimney smoke, breaks the monotonous view.
3. Dust hangs over this well-trod road, which runs parallel to a wide, sparkling river, and a smaller dirt track through the grass at the water's edge. Traffic on the road is steady, but largely on foot—weary looking people who can only watch as those with means take to boats. The richest sail or are rowed down the river, miles passing beneath them as they take their ease. Those of more modest means ride ferries, pulled by mules and oxen plodding along the bank.
4. Trees' branches loom overhead, casting dark shadows over much of the dirt road that meanders through this thick forest. Wide enough for two horses to ride abreast, the hard-packed soil offers solid footing, but no smooth passage for anyone who may have the misfortune of riding in a wagon or carriage. Heavy undergrowth grows just off the path, providing cover for predatory animals— or other things—lurking nearby.
5. This dwarven-made stone path hugs the side of the mountain; a jagged cliff wall rising high above on one side, and nothing but open air and a long fall on the other. The occasional fallen boulder makes the path all the more treacherous, forcing passers-by who prefer to hug the rock face to move away from safety toward the open side of the path to pass.
6. Barely worthy of being called a road and certainly not wide enough for travellers to move in more than single file, this animal track meanders through the wilderness. Sharp shrubs and bushes stab the legs of those on this overgrown path, leaving ample evidence of travellers' passage for those trained to spot it. Riders must duck low-hanging branches and veer completely around the occasional fallen tree.
7. Pieces of worked stones poke through the earth and grass on this ancient thoroughfare. Sometimes the old road is whole enough to smooth passage; other times, it is broken and jagged, little more than a tripping hazard to be avoided. Signs of the road's history are evident in the crumbling wall that still serpentines alongside, even if it no longer provides any proper delineation between the road and the encroaching wilderness.
8. This moss path through the forest leads straight ahead, almost as if the trees themselves were moving out of its way. Where a moment before it looked like a traveller might have to duck to avoid a low-hanging branch, it seems to crook at the last moment, angling itself around a head or high-rising gear. A glance back reveals the woods closing in behind the travellers, only a few dozen feet of road visible before nature obliterates any sign of passage. Glimpses of small mushroom circles in the underbrush offer tantalising hint of what forces may keep the way open, but always seem just out of reach.
9. Water drips steadily down the cave walls, feeding the bioluminescent moss that lights this subterranean realm in ominous shades of purple. This underground road rises and falls with the cavern's natural flow, at times giving expansive views of the surrounds, while other times forcing travellers to duck their head or squeeze through a tight passage that offers only a way forward and no chance to turn back.
10. A dark miasma hangs over this grim road, paved with sun-bleached bones. Comprised mainly of longer bones —arms and legs—tightly fit together, it provides a sure path for those on foot or in a wagon or carriage. More dreadful are the sections comprised of skulls. Most are buried in the ground, serving as ominous, rounded cobblestones, but some few are set face up, vacant eye sockets staring eternally in judgment at those treading upon them. 





## PASSERS-BY 



1. BRITHUA GRAVELCAIRN LN female dwarf fighter 8 This dwarf's long brown hair is pulled into a tail held by a brass clasp. A long scar down the left side of her face, next to her eye, gives her an odd squint. Numerous scroll cases are tied to her two bandoliers, and she's laden with belt pouches and a small pack. Personality: Brithua longed to see the world as a child, and discovered a job as a courier was the best way to do that. Straight to the point when working—she's paid to deliver her message quickly, and has no time to waste—she's garrulous the rest of the time. She loves to share tales of new places, especially the food. Mannerisms: If she's not talking or sleeping, Brithua is likely eating, to keep her energy up. She vows she won't go anywhere her feet can't carry her (though she won't admit it, she's slightly scared of horses). Hook: Brithua was delivering a sealed message to a sage when she was attacked by a vicious beast. She was able to get away, but realised afterward the scroll case with the message is missing. She doesn't know if it was just ill fortune, or if the creature was trying to get the scroll, but either way she needs it back. She fears the beast is beyond her capability to fight, and hopes the characters will help.
2. HANATH MYNGE NE male human thief 3 This heavyset man offers a broad smile, his white teeth offsetting his black beard. Though dressed in fine clothes, he's covered in travel dust. He keeps a firm hold of the reins of a pair of mules hauling a heavily laden wagon. Personality: Hanath Mynge is an opportunistic travelling peddler who seeks gold wherever and however he can get it. Ostensibly that means selling goods to wealthy adventurers, but in truth, he has few scruples. Mannerisms: When he's nervous, such as while sizing up adventurers, Hanath grips the lapels of his fine jacket, revealing a chain shirt and short sword underneath. He subtly seeks to make sure others know he can take care of himself in case they are considering betraying him (before he can betray them). Hook: When Hanath spots a likely adventuring group, he offers to sell several minor magic items. If the group offends him—or simply seems to have enough money without a commensurate ability to protect themselves—he chats them up to find their destination. He then betrays their plans to nearby bandits, in hopes they'll attack and sell him back his recently sold items (should the bandits be captured, they're equally happy to betray Hanath to save their own skins).
3. SILDIA GONTAREL LG female half-elf fighter 6 This blonde half-elven woman, clad in a fine breastplate, sits upright on her tall chestnut stallion. Her piercing green eyes size up everything around her. Personality: The illegitimate child of a baron, Sildia was raised near the family, and given a job as a guard. Determined to overcome the circumstances of her birth, Sildia is devoted to her job and patrols the road in search of bandits. She initially comes across as cold, but warms up to those who fight alongside her and prove their worth. Mannerisms: Sildia hates dirt and mess; when she stops for the evening, she cleans her horse, armour and herself as soon as possible, taking a long bath if she's spending the night at an inn. Hook: Sildia is on the trail of a murderous group of marauders who have recently been plaguing travellers. She intently questions any group that looks like it may have dealings with bandits (whether as allies or enemies), and offers a reward for any information. She accepts sincere offers of help, with promises of rewards from her employer.
4. VERRO FEDRACI CG male gnome illusionist 5 A small black lizard peeks out from the wild shock of this gnome's green hair. A strong smell of moss emanates from the dark-clad figure standing just off the road. Personality: Verro was a typically curious gnome until he made a bad choice to approach some strange lights in the woods and found himself visited by a peculiar, otherworldly patron. He knows it seeks vengeance, though against what he hasn't figured out yet. Resigned to his fate, he seeks out anyone who may be seeking revenge and tries to help them in hopes he can win his freedom from his strange patron. Mannerisms: Verro feels he has little control over his own life, and speaks in a monotone. It's not that he doesn't feel emotion, he just doesn't express it because as far as he's concerned it doesn't matter what he thinks or feels. Hook: A fey tried unsuccessfully to lure a young traveller to a feast in the woods. In an attempt to settle the fey's anger at its failure, Verro seeks another (preferably willing) traveller to attend the revels. The fey wants only to have a one-night party and then send its guests off with a gift, though its sense of time in the material world isn't always accurate, and the” one night” party could last weeks or months. 





## HAZARDS ON THE ROAD 



1. A wagon with a broken wheel sits at the edge of the road, being worked on by a quartet of rough-looking humans (each LN male and female human fighter 1), armed with hatchets. Though this looks like a classic setup for bandits, in fact the group are trappers trying to bring their goods back to town. Unfortunately, they angered a local fey during their time in the wilderness and she's decided to teach them a lesson, starting with using her magic to damage their wagon. Worse, she's not particularly concerned about innocent bystanders getting caught in the mayhem.
2. Under their parents' gaze, several small children play happily, their screams and laughter carrying down the road as they throw stones into the trees alongside the road in mock bottle with goblins. The danger becomes all too real, however, when one of the stones hits a hornets' nest, sending a swarm of angry insects into the air. If no one intervenes, a child will be fatally stung by the angry swarm.
3. With a not-so-fearsome cry, a dozen kobolds rush from the woods with long quills they use as spears and— strangely—fearful glances over their shoulder. They demand gold from travellers, and any mounts or animal companions, but throw themselves to the ground in abject surrender if they take any wounds or half the gang is killed. If spared, they explain they were forced into banditry by a fearsome manticore, and offer their tribe's friendship to any who would rid them of the monstrous bully.
4. A bit of movement off the road just catches a character's eye; a closer inspection reveals humanoid figures with pallid flesh clawing at the ground on a nearby hill. These figures are ghouls digging up bodies from a recent battle. If they spot passersby, they attack, hoping to defend their feeding ground and add fresh meat to their meal. To make matters worse, spilling fresh blood in the area awakens the slain warriors, who resume their battle.
5. Moments after travellers round a corner, they hear a cry of alarm—their only warning as several boulders tumble down a cliff toward them. They're followed a few moments later by three women (all NE female half-elf thief 5) who cry out apologies for their careless dislodging of the stones as they were exploring, and offers to help anyone who's hurt. When they arrive, though, their intentions become anything but helpful as they draw shortswords and attack, starting with anyone injured by their trap. From above, two more bandits (both NE female half-orc thief 5) of the all-woman gang known as The Better Half rain arrows down on those who avoided the boulders.
6. Five figures (LE male and female human cleric 6) wearing blue hooded capes and breastplates bearing the symbol of a winding road leading to a star glower sternly at approaching travellers. Members of a fanatic, heretical cult of the god of travel, they demand an offering for the use of their lord's domain, a tithe of 10% of a traveller's wealth. Those who refuse are told the price will increase to 20% if the church must collect it by force. Offers to leave the path are dismissed as blasphemous, and dismissive of the miles already travelled on their lord's domain.
7. A trio of battered adventurers—Canan Jaw-Smasher (NG female half-orc fighter 8), Fosco Hairyfoot (CG male halfling thief 8) and Havainim Lamsaltyrr (LN male elf wizard 7) approach, clearly looking the worst for wear. They say they recently ventured into an ancient demonfilled ruin, and had to flee. Since then they've been attacked every night. They offer to give a piece of treasure—or directions to the ruin—if the characters heal them and even better help them fight off the demon they expect that night. They're true to their word, offering a platinum idol in exchange, oblivious to the fact the cursed statuette is drawing the demon's attention.
8. A shadow of a winged draconic shape crosses the road. Before the adventurers can react, a massive brass-scaled beast lands on the road with a loud thump and a cloud of dust. It roars in fury, accusing the party of stealing from its lair. Though it's a case of mistaken identity, the dragon, Cozipiria (female adult brass dragon), has little patience and gives only a short time to disabuse her of her error. If she can be persuaded, Cozipiria introduces herself and tasks her erstwhile opponents with finding the real thieves and returning her gold. She expects this “offer” to be accepted but can eventually be talked into offering a reward for this service. 





## CAMPING & CAMPSITES 



1. Cold ashes and charred logs sit in a small ring of stones in this small cave, mute evidence others have previously used it as a campsite. Several tools, covered in rust and their handles broken, lie discarded at the rear of the cave, where gouges on the rock show the former occupants were trying to expand the cavern.
2. The sounds of music, singing and laughter carry down the road from a circle of brightly coloured wagons. Horses, in the circle of lamplight, nicker under the watchful eyes of two teenager guards. The travellers, a joyful mix of humans, half-elves and half-orcs who go as the road takes them, effusively welcome passers-by to join them, though draw their children away from any who seem dangerous. They offer a simple repast of fish and happily share stories of where they've been.
3. The trees grow tightly around this grove, providing a wall that cuts off almost all sight, and protects from the elements. Leaf-covered boughs block the sky, keeping the small clearing into deep shadow. Acorns litter the ground, and squirrels chatter noisily at any intrusion keeping them from collecting the food.
4. Cliffs surround this small lake and rocky beach, which seems to be cut off from the outside world. Croaking frogs sing their calls, barely audible over the roar of the plummeting waterfall that drowns out any other noises. Fish swim in the clear water, occasionally leaping clear of the white froth to snatch an insect that lingered near the surface a moment too long.
5. Weeds and vines grow up the crumbling walls of ruins on this rocky hilltop. The ruin provides a clear view of the surrounding environs, though any campfire will clearly be just as visible to anyone looking in its direction.
6. Fiery light dances in the eye sockets of this massive, bestial skull, making it look like some undead monstrosity, but the sound of halfling chatter quickly dispels that impression. Whatever this creature once was, it's undoubtedly dead now, a long line of ribs rising in a sinuous line from where they're half buried in the soil. Its skull, still adorned with human-sized fangs, offers shelter from the elements, and the current inhabitants offer a cautious welcome to any who enter.
7. Wooden spikes arrayed in a ditch pointing outward surround a square clearing housing a patrol of two dozen soldiers. A pair of swordsmen in matching livery stands guard at a gap in the defences, eyeing any who approach with caution. Still, they offer a safe place to rest to anyone willing to surrender their weapons for the duration of the stay, along with a hearty meal and travelling cot. The soldiers are tight-lipped about their destination, but seem generally at ease, without any real expectation of danger.
8. A series of rough wooden lean-tos scattered around a stone quarry dot this plateau in the mountains. Two heavy wagons full of supplies stand under the close eye of two young dwarves. The sound of picks and hammers breaking stone echo through the air. A central fire offers the promise of heat and a hot meal, though the dwarven miners are loathe to share with strangers who have nothing to contribute.
9. This small roadside inn lays dark and cold; there is no sign of any occupants. The stout wooden door hangs broken on the hinges, long scratches marring the surface near the handle. The windows are barred with wooden boards. Inside, dried blood is visible on broken chairs and tables. A search reveals the dried goods in the pantry remain whole, and the half-dozen bedrooms upstairs seem unmolested. Most of the beds are still made, and the one that isn't holds evidence of use; the contents of a traveller's pack lie strewn out on the floor, as if hastily searched.
10. This small campsite sits between three gargantuan stone feet—all that remains of a statue erected aeons ago by an ancient civilisation. Each foot faces outward in a different direction, with four monstrous toes, and a series of stone boulders circle the ankles in some representation of prehistoric jewellery. Some shattered chunks of statue break up the ground around the feet, though much of the stone appears to have been removed sometime before. Moss and other flora cover the few remaining pieces, which offer no identifying marks. 





## THE WEATHER 



1. It's a perfect day to be on the road, with sunny skies and just a couple of fat, puffy clouds. A slight breeze keeps it cool. The conditions are ideal, and travellers make it an additional 10% farther than they would normally.
2. The sun is out, and merciless, beating down on the characters. To make matters worse, the humidity is oppressive, causing creatures to sweat even when they're not moving. Travellers get fatigued in half the time they normally would if they don't have ample drinking water.
3. Lightning cracks from the dark sky, followed almost immediately by a boom of thunder, as a storm breaks overhead. The heavy downpour reduces visibility, and makes it much harder to use ranged weapons.
4. A light shower breaks the heat and humidity of the morning and leaves the afternoon cool and refreshing.
5. A chill wind cuts through travellers' clothing, finding every loose stitch and open tie. Leaves and other debris whip along the ground, occasionally hitting travellers with an uncomfortable slap. It's difficult to see at a distance, or use ranged weapons.
6. A hard rain soaks everything, and leaves the road slick and muddy. The conditions leave spattered mud on travellers and slow passage, reducing the distance travelled by 10%.
7. Dark gloomy clouds cast everything in shadow, though the rain holds off for now.
8. A heavy wind keens as it whips through the woods. With a loud crack, a heavy tree begins to topple, seemingly in slow motion. The massive trunk falls toward the road to crush anything unfortunate enough to be under it.
9. A dense fog shrouds the ground, cutting visibility to almost zero. Though it remains easy to follow the road underfoot, everything not in the immediate vicinity is hidden by the mist.
10. A large plume of sky and a ruddy glow in the distance give the first warning of danger ahead. Birds and other fauna flee as the sound of crackling flames grow louder from the approaching wildfire.
11. Hailstones the size of coins slam into the travellers, ringing off those clad in armour and bruising those without such protection. The hailstorm covers other sounds and causes minor injuries to anyone without some means of protection, such as a shield held overhead if they remain in the open too long.
12. The sunset paints the sky in spectacular shades of red, portending nice weather ahead.
13. The sound—almost a scream—of insects fills the air, making it difficult to hear anything else. Filling the air in their frenzy, the insects also make talking something to be avoided so they don't end up in an open mouth. Fortunately, they don't bite but still make themselves a nuisance landing on and slamming into everything.
14. A whipping wind tosses snow through the air, blowing almost sideways before it reaches the ground, where it piles in growing drifts. The blizzard makes seeing beyond arm's reach almost impossible, and cuts travel to a crawl through the snow. Travel speeds are reduced by half, using ranged weapons is nearly impossible, and anyone who doesn't have winter clothing or other protection may suffer frostbite.
15. A low rumble of thunder rolls ominously across the region, threatening storms in the near future.
16. A heavy hours-long rain leaves deep puddles in the soggy ground. A low rumble fills the air, growing more intense with each passing moment. Suddenly, a wall of dirty brown water comes rushing down the path, tumbling rocks, branches and even fallen trees before it as a deadly flash flood hurtles toward the party.
17. Sere grasses cover the dry, cracked soil, while larger plants droop, leaves curled and withering in dire need of moisture. The drought has dried a nearby river to the barest trickle and makes any stray spark a potentially disastrous fire hazard.
18. Dawn splashes crimson colours, a thing of beauty but also perhaps a portent of storms or other foul weather in the coming hours, across the sky.
19. Light snow falls, adding an ethereal beauty to the surroundings and muffling sounds. The dusting makes the ground a little slippery, but isn't heavy enough to slow travel.
20. Clouds of minuscule flies fill the air, occasionally getting into the mouth, nose and eyes of those who pass through the swarm. The flies do no physical harm, but make travel unpleasant and annoying. 





# ORC VILLAGE 


## ORC VILLAGE SIGHTS & SOUNDS 




### UNAWARE OF INTRUDERS 



1. The deep bellow of an angry orc followed by the highpitched screaming of another creature shatters still air. The second creature does not sound like an orc. Any other orcs in sight, pay no attention to the commotion.
2. An orc child beats a cowering slave who has his hands over his head in an attempt to ward off the worst blows. Each time the child's cudgel comes down on the slave, blood splatters the ground.
3. The stench of wood smoke, cooking fires, sweat and other unwholesome things drifts through the village.
4. Two orc children, wielding wooden weapons, are enthusiastically beating each other. Their high-pitched battle-cries would be comical, except each tiny warrior seems intent on inflicting serious harm on the other.
5. An orc woman, wearing dirty studded leather armour and carrying a sizeable water-filled bucket, violently cuffs an orc child around the back of its head. As she turns away, the child's murder-filled stare speaks volumes as to its feelings and future intent.
6. Low chuckles, pregnant with malice, along with a faint, high-pitched sobbing reaches the most perceptive character's ears. The sounds are coming from the nearest building.
7. A leather-clad orc warrior slumps against one wall, his head in his hands. He is oblivious to the characters' presence as he is nursing an epic hangover.
8. The wounded bellowing of a cow, or other large animal, cuts through the general din of the village. A few seconds later, an audible wet thunk brings the bellowing to an abrupt end.
9. Somewhere deeper into the village, someone starts to beat a large drum. Its throb passes through the village; several orcs howl in appreciation.
10. A burly orc warrior drags a human woman toward a hut. The woman sobs, but does not resist her captor, even though he is dragging her by her hair. 

### AWARE OF INTRUDERS 



1. A half-starved mongrel dog stalks through the village. The animal's ribs are showing through its mottled grey and white fur; if it sees the characters, it snarls and barks.
2. The shouts of orc battle-cries and the harsh clamour of weapons rhythmically beaten on shields echoes through the village; the orcs are preparing for battle.
3. The tramp of heavy feet and the jingle of armour comes from close-by.
4. A bloody, disorientated human staggers into view. The man has no shoes and wears ragged, blood-stained clothes. Shouts behind him cause him to spin round which reveals a black-fletched arrow buried deeply in his left shoulder.
5. A small group of orc warriors dash across an open space between two buildings. They are not heading for the intruders; either they haven't seen the characters, or they are trying to out-flank and trap them.
6. The pounding sound of two drums beaten in unison echoes through the village. A chorus of orc voices is raised in a battle-chant. The chant is a horrible song; it speaks of the orcs' enemies' horrible fate—to be feasted upon by the victors.
7. The shutters over the windows of the nearby huts are shut, and the doors barred. Here and there unattended items—a bucket, a bundle of cloth (now hopelessly muddy) and a battered helmet lie scattered in the mud.
8. An arrow thumps into the ground at a character's feet. A few moments later, a second bounces from another character's armour or shield.
9. Clouds of smoke, from cooking fires and the like, drift across the village, suddenly cutting visibility before it is restored mere moments later. One such dense cloud of smoke descends on the party seconds after they spot a large group of nearby orc warriors…
10. Two orc children—filled with battle lust, the invincibility of youth and a desire to prove themselves to the tribe's warriors—creep through the village. If they spot the intruders before the characters notice them, they charge screaming high-pitched battle cries. (Even hardened adventurers may baulk at killing children—even armed, homicidal children). 





## ORC VILLAGE DRESSING 



1. A half-dozen sun-bleached skulls dangle from a hut's overhanging thatched roof. The skulls—set out perhaps as trophies or particularly barbaric wind—chimes clack against one another in the breeze.
2. Tied to a hitching post with a length of short, frayed rope, a miserable-looking, half-starved goat noses among the mud and weeds for something to eat.
3. Sharpened wooden stakes driven deep into the ground and connected by woven tree branches form a ramshackle fence. A grinning skull tops each stake.
4. A weapon rack stands against one wall of a hut. Eight unfinished spear shafts fill the rack; none of the weapons as yet has a spearhead.
5. A dejected-looking, beaten cow stands mournfully in a small pen. Its eyes are glazed over, and its head hangs listlessly. The cow makes no attempt to graze on the sparse grass dotting the ground.
6. A pall of smoke, fed by thin streams of smoke rising from several chimneys, hangs over the village. The smell of smoke and cooking meat fills the air, and the faint clatter and hubbub of daily life reach the characters' ears.
7. A discarded suit of studded leather armour lies draped over a crude bench standing in front of a hut. Several large, bloody holes in the armour's chest hint at the fate of whoever last wore the suit.
8. A stacked pile of wood haphazardly leans against one sagging wall of a hut. The hut is in bad repair—it is possible the woodpile is stopping it from collapsing.
9. A fence of sharpened wooden stakes, set at a sharp angle, keeps casual visitors away from this stout, wellmaintained hut. Each stake is around four-foot-high and stout enough to impale a charging attacker.
10. An odious smear of noxious mud and other fouler things fill a shallow depression lying between several huts. Here and there pieces of rubbish—broken equipment, discarded clothes and so on—jut from the foul ooze.
11. A rickety wooden stair leads up to a platform about sixfoot high. Five irregularly shaped hanging posts—cut from thick branches—rise above the platform. Decomposing bodies hang from three of the posts and sway slightly in the breeze. Arrows jut from all three corpses. (The orcs use them as target practice.)
12. The muddy, bare ground is churned up—virtually no vegetation grows within the village. Rubbish and filth is strewn about everywhere. 

## INSIDE AN ORC HUT 



1. The floor is of packed earth covered with old, rotting rushes, bracken and so on. The stench of sweat and smoke lies heavily in the air.
2. Several battered shields hang from the hut's walls. A thick shafted spear leans near the door—ready for immediate use. Shafts of pale light pierce the thatched roof creating thin rays of light which faintly illuminates the hut's interior.
3. Shafts of pale sunlight pierce the hut's interior through the thatched roof; strange shadows move across the floor—the hut's inhabitants have hung several bags from the rafters. The bags sway slightly, creating the shadows.
4. Several throwing axes jut from one of the hut's walls. The splintered wall in the general vicinity of the axes is “decorated” by many obvious axe strikes.
5. A filthy rug covers a portion of the floor near the hut's fire pit. The rug hides a small, poorly concealed storage niche roofed in timber planks. Pulling up the planks reveals the orc's (meagre) treasures.
6. Five leering skulls—of the orc's rivals—fill a shelf above its bed. Several exhibit obvious signs of violence. A small pile of damaged wooden boxes hold the orc's meagre possessions and foodstuffs. None of the items is valuable or noteworthy.
7. An iron chain attached to a slave collar is wrapped around an iron spike hammered into one wall. Investigations, reveals flecks of dried blood on the collar.
8. Perceptive characters notice a bit of the hut's earthen floor is not as hard-packed as the rest. Digging in the spot uncovers a small coffer holding the orc's treasures. 





## NOTABLE ORCS 




### WARRIORS, CHAMPIONS & CHIEFS 



1. Bork (CE male orc) is an unsophisticated brute happiest in the midst of battle. A livid battle-scar runs across the top of his bald head, and he is missing one ear. Bork has filed his teeth to sharp points and loves nothing more than worrying the flesh of a still-living foe.
2. Enok Throatripper (CE female orc) is rake-thin but possesses a wiry build that belies her strength. She has long black hair she wears in four filthy plaits decorated with beads and tiny pieces of bone. She is savage and loves to rip out her enemies' throats. Even the other orcs are cautious around her.
3. Grak (CE male orc) is a savage maniac who delights in grappling his opponents and holding them tight while his fellows stab and hack them to death. Grak is also something of a kleptomaniac, and he can't help but stop and loot the fallens' bodies. He is bald, and several old scars decorate his scalp.
4. Kagel (CE female orc) is feral. She misses most of her front teeth but her tusks remain impressive. Kagel has developed a warbling, whistle-like battle cry she uses to strike fear into her enemies. Her nose has clearly been broken repeatedly; consequently, she must breathe through her mouth. She is popular with her companions because of her unnaturally passionate lusts.
5. Xugal (CE male orc) was crippled—he lost his left leg below the knee—in a recent skirmish and is yet recovering from his wound. He hobbles about on an improvised crutch and craves a warrior's death. At sight of the characters, Xugal hops towards them screaming insults and brandishing his handaxe. If he wasn't homicidally intent on their deaths, he might look a little stupid.
6. Lakak (CE female half-orc) appears virtually human and at first glance might appear as a mercenary serving with the tribe. More intelligent than her brethren, she has better armour—fine chainmail—and carries an ornate shield bearing a roaring lion emblem. She is not as unthinkingly savage as her fellows and has no intention of fighting to the death. If the characters seem gullible, she might surrender and try to convince them she is worthy of mercy—describing in great depth the abuse the tribe has heaped upon her. 

### OTHER RANK & FILE 



1. Uragh (CE female orc) is immensely fat and beyond ugly. She wears a filthy, ripped shift that does little to protect her modesty. Uragh watches over the chief's concubines and household. Savagely devoted to the chief, she carries a whip she uses on any she deems disloyal.
2. Ghamborz (CE old male orc) is a rarity among orcs in that he has reached old age—an almost unparalleled feat in the tribe's history. Ghamborz has survived because of his unswerving loyalty to the chief's family and his high intelligence. His hard-won battle cunning and natural intellect have served the tribe well. Still muscular, despite his age, he has long, straggly grey hair and wears fine studded leather torn from an elf's bloody corpse decades ago. He serves as the chief's honoured advisor.
3. Furze (CE male orc) is responsible for cooking the tribe's communal meals—which often include the diced bodies of fallen enemies. He wears splattered, dirty and bloodstained trousers, but goes about bare-chested (to better display the crude tattoos covering much of his upper body). He literally slavers in the presence of helpless foes—anticipating the pleasure he'll feel adding them to his pot.
4. Narz (CE female orc) is small, lithe and cunning. One of the tribe's most puissant scouts, her movements are quiet and controlled. She wears deliberately filthy armour designed to blend into the surroundings. Always wary, Narz is difficult to take by surprise. 

## SHAMAN 



1. Targ (CE male orc) has no body hair. Instead, he has decorated his face, neck and arms with lurid, and crude, tattoos of dismembered bodies, battle scenes, weapons and the like. His flat black eyes betray no emotion, except hate. He is utterly without mercy or compassion. Dedicated to the orc's blood-splattered pantheon he drives the tribe's warriors into battle with shouted tales of great orc victories. Some might misidentify him as an orc battle-bard; that would be a mistake.
2. Wingak (CE male orc) has a thin streak of human blood lurking in his ancestry—hence his pale blue eyes and streaked blond and black hair. Such a strange appearance marked him out as chosen by the gods, and Wingak joyfully plays along; he acts mad—as if touched by the gods themselves and capers about near-naked. For all that, he is not stupid—he wants to live—and he does not needlessly throw his life away.
3. Shurz (CE middle-aged female orc) appears unassuming at first glance. Merciless and utterly devoted to the orc pantheon, Shurz holds much influence in the tribe. The tribe's children are particularly afraid of her, and several terrible rumours about her horrific practices circulate among them.
4. Bakh (CE male orc) is horribly scarred as a result of his devotions to a particularly warlike, savage orc deity. His face is a mass of scar tissue and burns while his left arm ends at the elbow. Bakh craves heroic death in battle so he might serve his lord in the afterlife. He gladly fights to the death—bizarrely with a smile on his face. 

### CHILDREN 



1. Xug (CE young male half-orc) is a mongrel—a half-orc— and as such is often beaten and bullied by the other children. Xug hates this place and wants to leave (but not before inflicting horrible revenge on his tormentors). If he can do a deal with the party, he will. Xug owns a long, needle-like dagger he intends to put to good use. He honours any fair deal he makes with the characters but has no interest in joining their group for longer than necessary. As soon as he is clear of the tribe's territory, he abandons the party and strikes out on his own.
2. Ral (CE young male orc) is apprenticed to one of the tribe's shamans. He wears fine, but dirty clothes, taken from a nobleman's daughter and has spiked his hair up with a mixture of mud and twigs. A new initiate, he is without spellcasting powe r s bu t tries to bluster his way through any confrontation with intruders.
3. Batax (CE young female orc) was orphaned at an early age after her mother died in a raid (her father having died long ago). Unwanted by all—and seen as little more than an extra mouth to feed—she survives on the tribe's fringes. Depending on her mercurial mood she might be willing to betray the tribe or lead the characters into a trap to gain favour with her fellows.
4. Urzal (CE young female orc) is growing up into a genuinely odious, terrible individual. She bullies the other children—even those bigger than herself—and will shortly join the ranks of the tribe's warriors. If the village is attacked, she grabs the nearest weapon and hurls herself into battle. 





## ORC TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. This ancient and worn dwarven axe has a crudely serrated blade—which is clearly a later addition. Dried scalps and wolf teeth decorate its stained wooden haft which also bears scores of notches along its length.
2. Two-dozen large iron nails pierce this carved wooden statuette of an orc deity. Crude holy symbols of enemy gods decorate each nail's head. One of the horrible symbols defies easy identifications and does not seem to be of orc origin.
3. This doll of an orc child has real hair, teeth and nails. It has amber stones for eyes. A hidden needle coated with sleeping poison pricks whoever squeezes the doll.
4. Six jars hold pale chunks of meat floating in foul-smelling brine. A thick layer of yellow wax seals each jar. While the pickled meat is hard to stomach, they function as iron rations.
5. A leather purse tied with an intricate knot contains 4d6 bear's teeth, each dipped in molten gold. Each tooth is worth 1 gp—perhaps more to a collector or an orc.
6. This thoroughly vandalised spellbook is missing over half its pages; various foul substances smear those that remain. Careful cleaning salvages 1d4-1 low-level spells.
7. A small leather pouch contains the dried remains of a brown fist-sized toad. Tiny amounts of hallucinogenic poison seep from the cracked skin.
8. This tattered war standard bears the faded crest of a nearby kingdom. The current military commander promises a favour to anyone who returns the standard.
9. A pile of smouldering embers holds seven brittle human ribs carved with glowing orc runes. Touching the bones causes them to crumble into ash.
10. A mangy, skittish dog circles the village, looking for food. Attached to its worn leather collar is a silver medallion bearing the letter ‘V' in Common. (The medallion is worth 5 gp.)
11. Orcs use this set of slender metal eating utensils to extract marrow from thin bones. In a pinch, they can serve as improvised lock-picks.
12. Several strings of dried orc and human ears dangle from frayed cords. One ear is still fresh and bloody and clearly elven. Three elegant silver studs pierce the lobe.
13. A beautifully cut fire opal sits in the centre of a cracked leather eyepatch. When exposed to moonlight, the stone shines a dull, eerie red. It is worth 50 gp.
14. Six dusty green glass bottles of once-fine elven wine remain in this wooden crate. Though the contents have long since turned to vinegar, an empty bottle and three tankards nearby suggest the orcs do not mind.
15. A dozen mangy pelts are crudely stitched together to make this reeking suit of bulky hide armour. Sewn inside are six concealed dagger sheaths. All but one of the weapons is missing.
16. This clay statuette of a charging boar with a two-inch slit cut into its back rattles when moved. It can only be opened by breaking it. Inside are 3d6 copper pieces and two small broken orc tusks.
17. Wrapped in a bundle of greasy linen are eight pale yellow candles made from animal fat. They are difficult to light and give off a sharp smell. The flame continually sputters and tends to go out at inopportune times.
18. This waxed and polished orc skull is clearly an object of reverence. A tall black iron crown is nailed to the brow, and its broken tusk has been repaired with a silver spike.
19. The barbed point at the rear end of this iron hook is meant to be hammered into the end of an arm bone to replace a lost hand. With the addition of a rope, it can serve as a grappling hook.
20. Graven orc runes decorate this pair of great ram's horns bound together with copper bands and end in a shared mouthpiece. It produces a loud braying when blown—the orc signal to attack. 





# RUINED CASTLE 


## OUTSIDE THE RUINED CASTLE 



1. Thick stands of brambles and bushes ward the ruin's approaches. Here and there, game trails force their way through the dense undergrowth.
2. Tracks in the dried mud betray the presence of animals— perhaps deer, foxes and wolves—along with other more dangerous bipedal predators.
3. Partially hidden by thorny bushes, and the boughs of two youngish saplings, a tumbled pile of moss-covered stones hints at an ancient burial.
4. The mouldering remains of a tattered brown cloak are snagged on a thorny bush. They flutter in the breeze; inattentive—or paranoid—characters may assume the cloak is a lurking enemy.
5. A decaying arrow, its fletching long since rotten away, juts from a tree trunk.
6. A humanoid's yellowing bones sprawl among the weeds. A crushed skull and the total absence of the unfortunate's legs hint at a violent and grizzly death. Rusting fragments of equipment lie scattered around the skeletal remains.
7. Bushes and trees crowd thickly along the rutted and overgrown trail leading to the castle's gate.
8. The blackened, scorched ruin of an ancient tree looms hard against the trail. Its skeletal branches arch high overhead as if to fend off any younger, healthier trees daring to encroach on its territory.
9. A campfire's wind-scattered remains hint that previous explorers dared not camp with the castle's crumbling walls; perhaps they feared the ghosts of those who once dwelled—and died—within.
10. Bones—threaded together with twine—hang from tree branches and clack together gently in the breeze. Nearby, a skull leers down at travellers from its perch atop a spear thrust deep into the ground. A blackbird perches atop the skull and tries to smash a snail's shell open by banging it on the skull's forehead. 





## OUTSIDE IN THE RUINED CASTLE 



1. Moss and lichens grow in patches across the castle's crumbling stone walls. In places, the growths entirely obscure the stonework.
2. A scattering of rubble mars the mud and weeds of the castle's courtyard. Here and there, stands of taller grass, tangled brambles and small bushes complete the look of decrepitude and abandonment.
3. The blackened, crumbling carcass of a cart lies amid the rubble and ruin. One of its wheels is missing. Perceptive characters find the wheel's shattered remains a short distance away, languishing in a patch of thick weeds.
4. The battlements atop this section of the wall look to be in particularly bad repair. Moss grows thick across the wall here—and could be the only thing holding the crenelations in place!
5. Weeds grow thickly between the pitted, tilted flags comprising the floor. Some of the flagstones have shifted and moved as a result of subsidence, and rock gently when walked upon. Paranoid characters may suspect a trap.
6. Doorways and windows gape wide—their doors and shutters long since rotting away. Deep shadows cluster thickly beyond; perhaps within lurk the castle's hungry, feral denizens…
7. The splintered remains of the wall's crenellations look like the jagged, broken teeth of some gigantic beast.
8. A chunk of partly buried masonry lies at the base of the wall. Thick weeds grow around the stone block. Perceptive characters spot two skeletal legs concealed in the weeds. The skeletal legs protrude from under the chunk of masonry, suggesting the rest of the body may lie underneath.
9. Fresh tracks in the mud show where someone has recently walked. Judging by the footprints' depth, the individual was heavily laden. Additional investigation reveals the tracks go in both directions.
10. A ramshackle wooden building—perhaps once a wood store—leans drunkenly against the castle wall. The structure is dangerously unstable and could collapse at any moment.
11. A rotting wolf's corpse sprawls in a building's shadow. The remains are old and have been worried by scavengers. The wolf's cause of death is unclear.
12. The ragged remains of a flag or banner yet cling to the castle's flagpole atop a high tower. The shredded flag still flutters forlornly in the breeze.
13. Blackened stones and scorch marks around an arch show where intruders set a fire to gain entry. The door is gone, but its partially melted and twisted hinges remain.
14. A rusting longsword lies hidden in the weeds. Its blade is pitted and weatherworn, and the sword's leather grip has rotted away. The sword shatters if used in combat.
15. Wind-blown leaves form a waist-high drift against one wall. The leaves hide several small, rotting crates and barrels. The barrels once held provisions, but the food is now nothing but a foul-smelling suppurating mess. Attracted by the rotting food, all manner of vermin infest the “leaf drift”.
16. Scratches low down on one wall list the names of several men-at-arms who served at the castle.
17. A low, narrow hole in a wall provides an impromptu means of entering one of the castle's buildings. The hole is jagged, and rubble lies scattered about. Nearby rests a large chunk of masonry overgrown by weeds.
18. One of the castle's towers has developed a distinct list and leans outwards from the abutting walls.
19. The defaced and scratched crest of the castle's original owner yet decorates the wall above an empty doorway.
20. Partially hidden by a fallen, rotting door, a warrior's skeletal remains—still clad in rusting scale mail—sprawl on the ground. 

### MINOR EVENTS 



1. The wind moans through the ruins, seemingly giving voice to the castle's melancholy. For a moment, it seems like the castle is a living, tortured thing.
2. The clatter of falling rocks from further into the ruin echoes about the walls.
3. A flutter of movement in one gaunt window catches a character's attention. After a few minutes, the movement repeats itself. Perceptive characters realise the movement is a fragment of tapestry caught in the breeze. Other—more paranoid—characters may think it is a lurking foe.
4. Birds explode outwards from a nearby window, calling frantically to their brethren. Their screeches are quickly taken up by others roosting elsewhere in the ruin.
5. A sudden feeling of cold and foreboding sweeps over the party. The sensation lingers for a few minutes before disappearing as quickly as it arrived.
6. A character begins to feel the nagging sensation of being watched. The feeling persists until they either leave the castle or enter one of its ruined buildings. 





## INSIDE THE RUINED CASTLE 



1. Scratches and marks on the wall record the names of the folk that once dwelled here. Some of the names have a date alongside them; some are surprisingly recent.
2. Charcoal smudges on the wall show where someone once stubbed out a torch.
3. The faint smell of mould and rot hangs in the air. Shortly thereafter, the party discover a pile of rotting wood and fabric mouldering away against a wall. (It looks like a tapestry fell over a piece of furniture).
4. The flagged floor is rough and uneven—some of the flagstones have shifted with the passing of the years.
5. A dry, rust-coloured stain on the floor and one wall show where someone lost a lot of blood long ago. It is doubtful the injured person could have survived such a terrible wound without magical aid.
6. Crumbling mortar has made the archway above this doorway dangerously unstable. Incautious movement through the opening could result in several stones falling (onto the unfortunate passing through).
7. The next door the characters encounter is intact, but horribly swollen in place, making it difficult to open.
8. The pungent smell of mildew fills the area around an open and upturned chest. A thin whitish coating—minute fungi—covers the empty chest.
9. Dust-shrouded cobwebs hang thickly from the ceiling. Thin tendrils of the web—long enough to caress the characters' shoulders— waft gently in the breeze.
10. Indistinct marks in the dust hint at the presence of small scuttling creatures—perhaps rats or monstrously large centipedes—in the vicinity.
11. The mouldering bones of a large piece of wooden furniture lie overturned in the dust. Its panels are smashed; much of the whole is missing. Shortly afterwards, the characters discover the burnt-out remains of a campfire below a soot-blackened ceiling.
12. The pungent smell of rot presages the discovery of several sacks of rotting grain and other foodstuffs. Near the spoiled food, the stench is particularly intense.
13. A small wall niche holds the partially burnt remains of several candles. A dusty flint and steel also fill the niche.
14. Shards of broken pottery cover the floor. In a corridor, the shards cover the floor from wall to wall. In a room, they ward a doorway. (The characters could theorise the shards were placed this way to serve as caltrops).
15. The remains of an ineffectively set tripwire stretch across the next doorway the characters discover. The wire wraps around a small peg on one side of the door and is attached to a precariously balanced metal shield on the other side.
16. Faded, yellowing whitewash peels from the walls in this musty, water-damaged locale.
17. While the tapestry decorating this wall is long gone, the thick, long rusting hooks which once held it in place are still evident high up near the ceiling.
18. A pile of old, dry dung sits incongruously on the floor in this area. Rangers, druids and the like can tell the muck came from a large animal.
19. A spidery network of cracks runs through the walls of this place; none of the cracks is structurally significant.
20. The next door the characters discover is intact and locked. Luckily, the door's key is in the lock. Unluckily, the key and lock have rusted together. The door is also slightly swollen and thus challenging to open. 

### MINOR EVENTS 



1. A faint scuffing sound reaches the characters' ears. It could be the sound of someone moving stealthily or something sliding down a wall. The sound comes from a random direction.
2. Cold water drips from the ceiling onto a characters head.
3. The clang of metal on stone echoes through the ruins. Whatever caused the clang, it must have hit its target hard. There is no second clang.
4. A faint thud—perhaps a body falling or someone dropping a full sack—reaches the ears of perceptive characters from some as yet unexplored area.
5. The sudden cawing of birds comes from outside. Characters wise in the ways of nature can tell something has scared or alarmed the birds.
6. Dust and mortar sift down from the ceiling. Perceptive characters hear a faint grinding from within the stones. (This is just the old stones of the castle shifting, but could cause some alarm among paranoid characters.) 





## DISCARDED GEAR 



1. A broken crossbow bolt lies on the floor below a small mark in the wall.
2. A burnt-down torch stub.
3. An old bandage caked in dust and dried blood.
4. A small pile of haphazardly dumped wood.
5. A ripped, brown cloak and a few other odds and ends of clothing. The trousers look singed.
6. One worn leather boot sized for a human or similar individual.
7. The long shard of a broken bottle.
8. A splintered club.
9. A badly dented helmet.
10. A torn sack.
11. A black button lies hidden in the dust. The button is of obsidian and worth 2 gp.
12. The splintered remains of a lute hangs from a small protrusion jutting from the wall.
13. Blackened, mouldy bread fills a torn and ripped wicker basket. The bread is obviously inedible.
14. A dagger's hilt. (The weapon's blade is missing.)
15. A pile of leaves and twigs pushed together into what could be a rudimentary bed.
16. One two-inch-long fang. (The tusk could come from an orc, wolf or similar creature).
17. A broken mirror.
18. A moulding bag containing a dozen inch-long nails and a carpenter's hammer.
19. A large looped keyring holding a half-dozen rusty cast iron keys.
20. A sundered 10-foot-long pole broken into two sections— one is three-foot-long, the other seven-foot. 





## UNDER THE RUINED CASTLE 



1. Water oozes through the wall—from the cracks between the faced stone blocks—to collect in a small pool on the floor. The air is musty.
2. Dusty cobwebs obscure the ceiling. In places, they hang from the ceiling and drift gently in the breeze.
3. The sound of water dripping into some far off pool or puddle reaches the party's ears.
4. The skeletal remains of a warrior lie sprawled across the flagstones. A spear rammed through the unfortunate's ribcage pins the remains to the floor. One bony hand still clutches the spear's shaft as if he had tried to pull the spear free before succumbing to his wounds.
5. A rotting wooden door hangs from its upper hinge at a crazed angle. Soft shards of rotting wood and the door's other hinge lie on the floor nearby.
6. Splatters of bat guano dot the floor.
7. A patch of white and dull brown fungi grow in a damp corner amid the bones of some previous unlucky explorer or denizen. Water oozes down the wall, behind the remains.
8. Deep cracks mar the ceilings pf the cellars or dungeon. A faint, damp breeze emerges from the cracks hinting at a connection to another, unknown space. After lengthy periods of rain, water drips from the cracks.
9. A pungent brown mould covers the floor. Indistinct marks amongst the noisome growth suggest someone has recently walked through the area.
10. A few small blobs of wax on the floor against one wall could—perhaps—betray the presence of a secret door (if the characters spot them).
11. A faint smell—akin to that of a wet dog—lingers in the air.
12. Shallow, muddy puddles partially cover the floor. Anyone walking through the puddles leaves easy-tofollow tracks for a score—or so—feet.
13. The next door the characters discover is pinned shut by an iron spike hammered into the floor. The iron spike is not rusted, suggesting it has not been here very long.
14. A small pyramid of carefully selected and piled stones decorates one corner. Clearly “harvested” from the ruins above the stones are carefully slotted together. Chips of stone and masonry dust cover the ground nearby.
15. The air is hazy, and the pungent smell of burning wood yet lingers.
16. A faint outline in the floor suggests the presence of an as-yet unsprung pit trap.
17. A bent torch sconce—forged to represent an ornate basket—hangs at an odd angle from the wall. From the looks of it, something gave the sconce a terrific whack which almost knocked it loose.
18. A scrap of burnt parchment rests on the floor. A spellcaster can determine it likely once held a magic spell and was consumed by flames when its magic was called forth.
19. In this section, the ceiling is unusually low—explorers taller than a dwarf must crouch before moving through the area.
20. The crude chalk figure of a kneeling woman, hands clasped in prayer, decorates one wall. The picture is practically life-sized but poorly done. If the area is wet, water has oozed down the wall giving the figure a blurred, streaky appearance. 

### MINOR EVENTS 



1. Cold water drips from the ceiling onto the party's heads.
2. A slight breeze blows through the dungeon toward the way the characters entered. Characters wise in the ways of dungeoneering may realise this movement hints at another as yet undiscovered entrance.
3. The dull crack and thud of stones falling reverberate through the ceiling. (Several large chunks of masonry have fallen in the ruins, above).
4. The skittering sounds of many tiny feet moving somewhere unseen in the darkness reaches the party.
5. The clang of something metal hitting stone reaches the party's ears.
6. A faint breeze heralds the arrival of a fetid smell redolent with death and decay. The stench is nearly overpowering and lingers in the characters' clothes and hair until they wash their clothes and bathe. 

## LOST TRINKETS & TREASURES 



1. A silver belt buckle forged to look like a gaping dragon's mouth attached to a mouldy leather belt.
2. A mouldy pouch holding a handful of silver and gold coins struck in a distant, virtually mythical realm.
3. A bolt of sky-blue silk wrapped in oilskin that has miraculously escaped the mould and damp.
4. A leather necklace hung with a half-dozen silver and gold nature-themed charms.
5. A silver nib attached to a mouldering ink pen.
6. A gold ring displaying the signet of the family who once lived in the castle above. 





# RUINED CITY 


## EVIDENCE OF PRIOR EXPEDITIONS 



1. A crude fire pit ringed with now-blackened stones taken from the ruins pierces the ground in the rough centre of this area. Larger stone blocks—perhaps used as seats— have been dragged close to the ash-filled pit.
2. A flutter of movement catches a random character's eye. Investigations reveal the filthy, shredded remains of a tent snagged on the remains of a tumbled stone wall.
3. Dried blood coats the dusty floor and crumbling wall, here. Perceptive characters can determine the stains are only a matter of weeks old.
4. A splintered arrow, its blue fletching withered and dusty, lies on the ground. The arrow is of elven manufacture and clearly not ancient.
5. An explorer's yellowing bones yet clad in rotting studded leather armour protrude from under a pile of tumbled masonry. The woman's legs and pelvis are crushed by the rocks, and the remains are contorted as if she died in great pain. The remnants of her equipment are scattered about—clearly, she did not die immediately.
6. Footsteps in the mud show where previous explorers have trod. A ranger or other tracker can tell the footsteps were left by heavy, human-sized individuals. The tracks only go in one direction and disappear into a nearby ruined building.
7. An abandoned campsite fills the ground floor of a partially ruined building. Several bedrolls, the remains of a cooking fire and the like are scattered about the ground floor rooms. By the looks of things, the campsite is months old.
8. Set into the shape of an arrow, this arrangement of stones suggests the direction of travel for a prior expedition. Moss grows on the stones suggesting they have been in this position for years.
9. Two rusting spades thrust deep into the ground, and several shallow holes, show where previous explorers have dug for buried treasure. Nearby, a rotting coffer—its lid ripped off and discarded nearby—lies on the ground.
10. Footsteps, drag marks, bloodstains and other signs of combat litter the area. No bodies or loot remain; it is as if someone has cleared up after the battle.
11. The bloated, rotting corpse of a mule lies crumpled on the ground. The mule still carries saddlebags, but nothing of value remains within—food is rotten, wine is spoiled and so on. The mule's injuries could provide a clue to alert adventurers to what lurks nearby.
12. A statue lies on its side near a plinth from which it toppled. Perceptive characters note a discolouration on the ground around the statue. If the characters move the statue, they discover the squashed remains of a previous explorer crushed all but flat by the statue's fall.
13. A backpack, poorly hidden beneath some vegetation, seems to hold nothing more than a bundle of rotting cloth. Examination, however, reveals a treasure hidden within. Cut into the form of a skull this yellowing crystal is an exquisite, yet disturbing, object. Subtle enchantments cast inside the skull give it a faint purple luminosity.
14. Amid mouldering equipment lie the yellow bones of a previous explorer. Near the individual's outstretched hand lies a headless statuette which was once a beautiful ornamentation set in an important person's quarters. (It depicts a nude anatomically perfect male of the race inhabiting the city.) The statuette's missing head is nowhere to be found. Nevertheless, the statuette remains valuable.
15. Obvious signs of battle mar the area. Splintered arrows, patches of dried blood as well as an obviously hastily built breastworks—now partially collapsed—speak to the violence once meted out here.
16. A faint wisp of smoke rises above the ruins. Investigation reveals a guttering, untended campfire. Camping equipment—enough for two individuals surrounds the fire, but of their owners, there is no sign.
17. An emaciated, near-death donkey wanders the ruins. It yet wears a bit and bridle of human artifice and has deep (partly healed) scratches along one flank. Any character wise in nature's ways can see the donkey has not eaten in weeks and is near death. If nursed back to health, the donkey forges an unshakeable bond with its new owner.
18. Incongruously, the rotting body of a peasant lies splayed on the ground amid a dried pool of blood. The man was a bearer for another expedition and was slain by the ruin's monstrous inhabitants. The character might find something useful in the man's pack.
19. The collapsed ruin of a once important building is the venue of an obvious excavation. Several piles of rubble and signs of organised digging suggest a previous expedition thought something valuable might lie buried within or under the building.
20. Buzzards, crows or some other appropriate type of carrion bird peck and tear at an adventurer's bloodied corpse. The characters might be able to recover useful equipment or even a map from the remains. 





## LOST TREASURES & TRINKETS 



1. A sheltered section of wall has withstood time's remorseless onslaught better than much of the rest of the ruins. Here faded fresco yet survive. A few sections of the fresco glimmer in the light. Perceptive characters realise the fresco was painted with paint comprising crushed gemstones. Careful explorers could harvest some of the glimmering paint.
2. Covered in thick moss and lichen, a statuette fills a small hidden wall niche. Investigation—involving scrapping off the moss—reveals the statuette to be a marble bust depicting a noble member of the race once dwelling in the city.
3. A secret treasure niche pierces the ground in the corner of h i s a r e a . P e r c e p t i v e characters realise a flagstone is l o o s e a n d can pry it up with little effort. Within lies a mouldered sack containing a store of silver and gold coins minted when the city was in its heyday.
4. The heraldic device of the city decorates several stones or bricks (as appropriate). At night, the runes emit a faint glow equivalent to that given off by a candle.
5. A life-sized statue of one of the city's former inhabitants lies facedown amid the rubble and ruin. The stone statue is heavy, but if the characters roll it over they discover small black gems—onyxes—serve as the statue's eyes.
6. A bas relief carving decorates a lichen-covered wall. Clearing away the lichen reveals a stylised map of the city in its prime. The map is not hyper-detailed but still provides a useful broad overview of the place.
7. The plinth of a fallen statue has a hidden compartment. Perceptive characters discover the compartment holds several items of religious significance—a small, black onyx sacrificial dagger and a plain silver circlet clearly not designed to be worn on a human head.
8. The characters discover some simple household goods— such as goblets, cooking pots and the like—wrought in strange, alien shapes. Such objects—while worthless to adventurers—have value to collectors, sages and the like.
9. A statue of a warrior holds a ceremonial shield that glimmers through a thick coat of dust and grime. Characters cleaning the shield discover it to be of solid silver and proudly bears the city's heraldic device; it is not designed for combat and if used in battle is quickly rendered worthless.
10. Preserved by powerful, time-defying magics this weighty tome is a history of the city and tells much of its storied past. The book comprises sheets of papyrus between hammered covers of bronze inscribed with various sigils and esoteric wards. The whole is wrapped in leather cured from the hide of some unknown creature. 





## MINOR EVENTS 



1. Dark clouds scud across the sky, plunging the ruins in a cold and shadowy twilight. Deep, brooding shadows gather among the tumbled walls and fallen masonry like predators gathering to hunt their prey. When the dark clouds move away the shadows dissipate, but the ruins seem sightly chiller than before to sensitive characters.
2. The wind gusts strongly. As it moans through the ruins, the wind picks up dust and grit; dust devils dance about the party throwing grit into the characters' eyes, ears and nostrils. The dust devils last for but a few minutes before the wind dies.
3. All background noise—the sound of the wind, the harsh cries of birds in the sky above and so on—abruptly cease. The resultant silence is pregnant with malice and foreboding; it is almost like the ruins are holding their breath—and waiting for something horrible to happen.
4. The scrabbling sound of claws on stone reaches the most perceptive character's ears. The sound comes from behind a pile of high rubble. The sound could be nothing more than a lone scavenger picking through the ruins in search of food or an enemy creeping towards the party.
5. An abnormally large crow perches on a nearby wall and regards the party with seemingly preternatural intelligence. If the party makes no attempt to slay or drive off the crow, it follows them for an hour or so before flying away. Alternatively, the crow could be the familiar of a wizard lurking elsewhere in the ruins.
6. Driven by a strong wind, sheets of rain pummel the city. The rain is heavy and persistent—it may force the characters to take shelter in a relatively intact nearby building; perhaps this seemingly random event propels them toward a particularly important part of the ruins.
7. A glint of light reflecting off metal catches a perceptive character's eye. The flash of light comes from deeper into the ruins. Investigation reveals a seemingly abandoned battered metal shield resting against a wall.
8. The sudden loud clatter of stones reaches the characters' ears. The sound could be caused by nothing more than a small localised collapse elsewhere in the ruins or could herald a sudden attack from some unknown foe.
9. The most paranoid character—or the least perceptive— spots a sudden, furtive movement in the nearby ruins. The movement could be nothing more than a trick of the light; it could also be, however, the furtive creeping of a natural creature or a lurking monster.
10. Clouds obscure the sun for much of the day. However, for a few short minutes, at an opportune time, the clouds part and the sun bathes the ruins in warm golden light. (If the characters require a clue as to where to proceed the sun's rays could highlight a particular part of the ruins, glint off a concealed enemy's armour and so on).
11. A flock of birds swoops over the party. One of the birds chooses that exact moment to defecate; a random party member is hit by the bird's leavings. Is this a good or bad omen, or just happenstance?
12. The faint sound of strange, alien music reaches the characters' ears. Perhaps the music features a bizarre arrangement or is played on unidentifiable instruments. The music continues for some minutes before tailing off and could be being played by another band of explorers, the descendants of the ruined city's inhabitants or an imprisoned fiend (or the like). Alternatively, the music could lead the party to their next encounter or a notable adventure site. 





## RUIN DRESSING 



1. Part of this wall is particularly high compared to others nearby and leans dangerously to one side. Any explorer with half a brain can tell the wall is dangerously unstable. This is an excellent place to lay an ambush or trap.
2. A huge tree lies on its side, fallen straight through a building. The tree's massive trunk has smashed the building's walls and roof; rubble lies scattered about. The fall could be relatively recent, or the tree could be dead and rotting when the characters arrive.
3. A field of virulent thorn bushes with spikes several inches long cluster thickly together, blocking easy progress. In places, the thorn bushes are twice the height of a grown man. Perceptive characters spot several small tunnels— perhaps forced by animals—wending their way through the bushes.
4. An obviously hastily piled, slightly lopsided stone cairn stands in the lea of two walls. A crude wooden marker, from which hangs a rusting helmet, marks the place as a grave. No inscription provides a clue to who lies within the cairn.
5. Birds and other wildlife avoid one particular part of the ruins. The area could harbour latent magical auras, be a graveyard or serve as the lair of some horrible beast.
6. Vines and creepers grow thickly over several crumbling walls. The growth is so fecund it could obscure doors and windows; the area beyond might make an excellent hiding place or spot from which to spring an ambush.
7. Small deposits of dried faeces bear mute witness to the presence of animals or monsters in the ruins. Characters wise in nature's ways—perhaps elves, rangers or druids— might be able to discern roughly what kind of creature left the deposits.
8. The walls in this section of the city—beset with crumbling mortar or other structural problems—are riddled with small holes. When the wind comes from one direction, it blows through these holes and makes a variety of sounds—from low moans to high-pitched shrieks— dependant on its speed.
9. A deep well stands in the middle of a courtyard or square. Weeds and small bushes grow nearby and moss and lichens cover the stonework of the well's shaft. The well is nearly dry, but some water still oozes through the rubble choking the bottom third of the shaft. Alternatively, the well was used as a convenient dumping ground for bodies during the city's fall and it could be haunted or its water irredeemably tainted.
10. A mouldy rope hangs from a building's roof or upper floor. From ground level, it is impossible to see the rope is secured to a poorly placed, rusting iron spike. Characters climbing the rope dislodge the spike and tumble to the ground.
11. Thick, fecund vegetation of an appropriate type for the surroundings grows in this area, making exploration difficult. Explores must hack their way through.
12. A massive tree—its branches flung wide—has taken root in this place; the flag- or cobblestones in the immediate vicinity are uneven as a result of the tree's questing roots. 

## DECORATION SUBJECTS 



1. A ruler stands in a heroic pose, looking into the middle distance. The ruler is depicted as an idealised member of the city's race. A nearby carving names the ruler.
2. A warrior stands over the prostrate form of a vanquished foe; the hero stands with weapon raised high as if about to strike. The vanquished foe looks terrified.
3. Depicted at the height of its glory, this decoration shows a notable location in the city such as a temple, tower or fortification. The decoration is so detailed an observer may be able to discern features of interest.
4. An important figure from the city's past stands in a contemplative pose. The figure could be a powerful priest, famed architect or clever wizard.
5. One or more of the deities worshipped in the city look down at those passing by.
6. An obvious criminal is depicted in a pose of supplication or punishment. A carving nearby names the criminal and their crime. Depending on the decoration type, a crowd of onlookers—their faces set in rapt expressions of excitement as they await the criminal's punishment— could also be depicted.
7. A magical sigil or collection of esoteric symbols is depicted close to, or entwined around, one another. The grouping could have some special significance to the city's folk or could be nothing more than a piece of art.
8. Complex geometric patterns—exquisitely detailed and picked out in yet-bright colours—decorate the area. The pattern could hide the trigger for a secret door, be part of a complex trap or nothing more than decoration.
9. Words carved in the city's common tongue proclaim a great teaching or pronouncement from its rulers. The carving may be damaged, defaced or partially obscured.
10. The sigil of the city's patron deity, carved into walls, picked out in mosaics and the like, is still visible throughout the city. 





## MAJOR RUIN FEATURES 



1. A network of cellars, basements and other subterranean passageways honeycomb the ground below this section of the ruins. Time's remorseless onslaught has weakened their ceilings and supports; unwary characters may cause a local collapse and fall into the network.
2. Leering, moss-covered statues stand upon cracked and teetering plinths. The finely detailed statues are lifesized. Nothing more than decorations, some are unstable and fall if disturbed by adventurers searching for hidden storage niches and the like.
3. One windowless tower—standing slightly apart from nearby buildings—is in much better condition than its neighbours. Its roof is intact, and a thick bronze double door, graven with many runes of dire and fell aspect, remains firmly shut.
4. The city's cobblestones and flagstones are a strange shape—triangular, circular or the like. Some cobblestones have glyphs, sigils or personal marks scribed into them.
5. The city's architects used a special kind of mortar in its walls; although faded and crumbling in many places the mortar is a strange colour, and might even have magical or quasi-magical properties.
6. Important buildings are a riot of decoration—beautifully carved reliefs and bas-reliefs cover most surfaces and depict important events in the city's past. Many of these carvings were originally painted, and flecks of paint survive here and there to give a faint impression of faded grandeur.
7. A sea of jagged, tumbled rubble blocks the street, m a k i n g f u r t h e r p r o g r e s s i n t h i s direction difficult. The rubble might also be unstable, and more t h a n a m e r e i n c o n v e n i e n c e t o unwary explorers.
8. Shades of the city's fallen gather in this place—the place of their death. They are insubstantial shadows easily missed by unperceptive or distracted explorers. The shades are harmless and ignore explorers, instead repeatedly acting out the last few moments of their lives.
9. Either through happenstance or some lingering magical energy, the ruined city has its own small weather system, which is at odds to that of the surrounding area. (For example, if the city stands in a desert cold and rain often beset it while a city in the middle of a rainforest could be suffering extreme drought conditions.)
10. Some parts of the city are decrepit and prone to collapse. Those exploring without due care and attention could cause walls to collapse, floors to give way and so on. Additionally, combat in these areas is particularly hazardous as powerful spells and the like might have a similar effect on nearby walls, floors and ceilings.
11. The city was the site of savage fighting, during its fall. Skeletons and other leavings of the elder battles lie scattered about the place. Some of the dead do not rest easily. The presence of warm-blooded, living creatures re-animates them as weak, low-level undead such as skeletons and zombies. Individually, such encounters should be easy to defeat, but their frequency will eventually wear down all but the most powerful group's resources and resolve.
12. Heroically-sized statues of important personages dot the ruins—standing in squares, at important road junctions and near important buildings. Some are weather-worn, and covered in lichens, moulds and vines (as appropriate) while others are in pristine condition. 




# RUINED MONASTERY 


## OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY 




### GENERIC DRESSINGS 



1. A gnarled, twisted ancient oak tree stands amid a thick stand of brambles. The tree's branches droop low making the bramble patch an excellent hiding place.
2. The bleached, weather-worn skeleton of a humanoid lies sprawled among the weeds. Even the most unobservant of characters can note the unfortunate's smashed skull; clearly, whoever they were, they suffered a violent death.
3. Stands of weeds, brambles and small trees press closely in upon the rutted track leading to the monastery's gates.
4. Tracks criss-cross the area, giving perceptive characters clues as to what might lurk in the surrounds.
5. Wind chimes of threaded bleached and cracked bones hang from the boughs of trees dotting the surrounds. The macabre wind chimes clack together, in even the slightest breeze.
6. A murder of crows roosts in the surrounds. Overly large, aggressive, and with a taste for warm flesh, the crows watch intruders intently and quickly swoop to feast on any newly slain creatures.
7. Rubble lies scattered about in the rough shape of a small outbuilding. Weeds grow through and within the rubble.
8. The foul sigil of a blasphemous power is burnt into the vegetation. The sigil is over 20-foot in diameter. At its centre, a pile of ash and splintered, scorched bones suggests a funeral pyre, aberrant ritual or burnt offering took place here.
9. An ancient burial cairn lies within the monastery's bounds. Several shafts have been cut into the cairn in search of buried elder treasures.
10. An old campfire fills a small, sheltered hollow. Marks on the ground suggest three human-sized creatures slept by the fire. 

### THE OUTER WALL 



1. Ivy grows voraciously across the crumbling boundary wall. Here and there, stones have fallen from the top of the wall giving it an almost crenellated look.
2. Part of the wall has collapsed, creating a heaped pile of weed-cloaked rubble. Many other small holes pierce the wall; when the wind blows it whines and wails through the holes—sounding like a legion of the damned.
3. Some of the wall's foundations have sunk and parts of the wall lean drunkenly outward. Characters climbing the unsafe parts of the wall risk it collapsing atop them.
4. Sharp shards of pottery and glass top the wall. Unwary characters climbing the wall might not spot the hidden danger, covered as it is with moss and lichen. 

### GARDENS 



1. A riot of weeds grows across the once ordered kitchen garden. Here and there, the remains of rotting tools jut from the chaos.
2. A rickety, worm-eaten hut yet stands upright. Its roof sags and the whole thing leans precariously to one side. (Opening the hut's door, causes the whole thing to collapse into a sodden heap of rotten wood).
3. A network of now weed-choked irrigation channels wends their way through the garden, lurking under the undergrowth to trip the unwary.
4. A shallow pool lies at the garden's centre. Choked with thick stands of reeds and weeds, the stagnant water is rank and unwholesome. 

### GRAVEYARD 



1. Thick clumps of dark-hued, noxious mud stud the ground, churned up as if by the tramp of many feet. Amid the mud, several weather-worn, crumbling grave markers jut drunkenly from amid the mire.
2. Heaped piles of earth and pieces of splintered, rotting wood surround an open grave. A mouldering (empty) coffin lies in the grave. Perceptive characters investigating the coffin discover scratch marks on the inside.
3. A wide, shallow hole serves as an unfinished mass grave. A tangled mass of bones, decomposing bodies and rotten clothes fill the hole.
4. Victims of subsidence and age, the graveyard's weatherworn grave markers stand at haphazard angles. Many markers are illegible. Some graves have no marker. 





## INSIDE THE MONASTERY 




### GENERIC DRESSINGS 



1. Cracked tiles set with skull motifs cover the uneven, water-damaged floor.
2. Thick, dusty cobwebs droop from the ceiling to only three-foot above the floor. Thick sections of web hold cocooned, desiccated insects, and when the wind blows through the area, the cobwebs undulate wildly.
3. Shards of rotting, shattered furniture has been pushed back against one wall, creating a tottering heap of sodden wood. Various crawling insects lurk within.
4. Cracks in the wall let in slivers of pale light which cast patterns on the floor. From one angle, a perceptive character realises the pattern is disturbingly familiar to the profane sigil of a demonic power.
5. Iron torches sconces jut drunkenly from the wall. The sconces are evil things and wrought in the shape of the unholy sigil of the monastery's foul patron.
6. Yellowing whitewash peels from the wall; the faint remains of a mural—destroyed by water damage long ago—are still faintly visible on the wall.
7. Mouldy cowled black cloaks hang from rusty iron hooks hammered into the wall. A foul sigil picked out in purple thread is emblazoned on each cloak's chest.
8. Ghastly carven images of death, slaughter and sacrifice cover the slender pillars holding the ceiling aloft.
9. Display niches high up in the walls hold leering, yellowed skulls set to stare down at intruders. Paranoid characters may suspect a trap or undead guardian.
10. Occasional black flagstones break up the uniformity of the otherwise normal flagged floor. Such flagstones could be nothing more than decoration or could serve another (sinister) purpose. 

### PLACE OF WORSHIP 



1. Scattered bones lie amid shattered pews and the detritus of war. Old bloodstains mar the floor and a smattering of rotting, rusting equipment adds to the forlorn scene.
2. Dusty, faded banners depicting scenes of evil's triumph over good hang from walls, reaching from near the ceiling to the floor. One or more may obscure the door to a secret chapel, hidden niche or escape passage.
3. Carved into the floor and filled with black gold (gold mixed with cobalt) a vast unholy symbol dominates the floor. Bits of the black gold have been chipped out, giving the sigil a haggard, diseased look.
4. Four deep pits pierce the floor on the chamber's perimeter. Ash, charred wood and splintered bones choke the pits.
5. Black wrought iron cages hang from the ceiling on thick, rusting chains. Bones fill the bottom of the cages.
6. A deep, shadow-cloaked viewing balcony overlooks the chamber. A narrow spiral staircase warded by a rusting iron gate provides access to the area. 

### PERSONAL CHAMBERS 



1. Graffito scratched into the floor radiating out from a ruined bed praises the monastery's dark patron and begs him or her for power, wealth and prestige.
2. A small prayer niche pierces the wall under a narrow window which emits a faint beam of pale light. A hideously deformed squat statuette of a demon or devil fills the niche and glowers down into the room.
3. Large dried bloodstains mar the floor near the chamber's rotting, sagging bed. Investigation reveals a jawless skull wedged between the bed and the wall.
4. A heavy overturned oak chest lies across the doorway. Still locked, the chest's key is long-lost. The chest contains clothes, a suit of armour and other mundane gear. (Roll on “Treasures, Trinkets & Trash”.)
5. Perceptive characters spot a loose flagstone hiding a storage niche. (Roll on “Treasures, Trinkets & Trash”.)
6. The previous occupant was an amateur artist. Badly drawn faded pictures of religious significance cover the chamber's dirty, whitewashed walls. 

### PUBLIC AREAS 



1. A rotten bench leans against the wall. Although once sturdy, the bench has seen better days. It collapses if anyone sits on it or tries to move it.
2. Deep scrape marks on the stone flags show where something—perhaps a chest, heavy table or pew—has been dragged.
3. The shattered remains of a stained glass window cover the floor in dusty, multi-hued debris. The remains of the glass's lead inserts hang precariously from the wall.
4. Blown by the wind, a bank of dried leaves, scraps of cloth and other bits and pieces of rubbish tangled up in and around a smashed chair choke a door- or archway.
5. The faint inscription “Elina Arpia was here” followed by a date decorates a wall. The graffiti is in Common and was obviously hastily carved.
6. A fell litany daubed in faded black paint runs around the walls of the area, at roughly a human's head height. 





## UNDER THE MONASTERY 




### GENERIC DRESSINGS 



1. Deep shadows that seem pregnant with malice cluster in the corners of this area. While light pushes the shadows back, they seem almost sentient and move disturbing at the edge of the party's vision.
2. The flagstoned floor has shifted over the years, creating an area of difficult terrain. Insects dwell in the cracks between the flags; their tiny droppings litter the floor.
3. The stub of a torch lies on the floor. Soot stains on the flags show it continued to burn after being dropped. Investigation reveals dried blood on the nearby stone.
4. Small holes at the base of one wall suggest an infestation of mice or rats; small droppings festooning the area confirm the presence of vermin.
5. Dirty, rust-coloured water oozes down the wall. The water smells faintly noxious. Several hollows in the floor hold deeper puddles; incautious characters stepping in them get wet and create a loud splashing sound.
6. Deep shadows cluster at the apex of this vaulted space, and sounds echo oddly in the area.
7. Part of a wall has collapsed, dumping bricks and crumbled mortar onto the floor.
8. Cold, dirty water drips from the ceiling onto the floor (and any explorers passing beneath). The constant dripping sound makes hearing stealthy movement tricky.
9. In the centre of the area, the flagged floor is smoothed as if by the passage of many feet. A mangled, rusting unholy symbol lies by one wall. Investigations reveal dried bloodstains on the symbol's chain.
10. Foul carvings of devils, demons and otherworldly creatures of the basest, most terrifying sort festoon the walls. Most are in bas-relief, but a few are in high relief and leer down at intruders passing by. 

### CELLARS & STORAGE 



1. A jumbled mass of broken barrels, smashed boxes, empty sacks and the like fills the back of this chamber.
2. The door to this chamber is swollen and jammed in place. Any character successfully forcing the door open actually rips (or pulls) the sodden wood from its hinges and may fall over so easy is the task.
3. Rubbish and human (or inhuman) remains fill a worked hole in the floor. Without excavating the rubbish, it is impossible to discern the hole's depth or where it leads.
4. Sagging, wooden shelves line the walls. Drifts of dust, collapsed boxes and other unidentifiable things fill the decrepit shelves which are obviously about to collapse.
5. A lumpy sack lies on the floor. As the characters approach, something inside starts moving. Moments later, a feral rat emerges and scuttles away.
6. A small oak coffer lies on the floor. Its lid remains shut but has several gouges in it as if someone had tried to smash it open. 

### CELLS & OUBLIETTES 



1. Rotting, stinking straw covers the floor of this area. Intermingled with the straw are the remains of a halfdozen individuals. Small holes pierce one wall—feral and emaciated starving rats dwell within.
2. Dried and smeared bloody handprints along with illegible scratching on the wall provide macabre decorations for this chamber which yet reeks of despair, sorrow and death.
3. Rough-hewn and slick with water the cell's walls meet in the centre of the room to form a natural chimney.
4. Small rusting cages set about the room's perimeter are barely large enough to hold a crouching human. Three of the eight cages hold bones and rotting fragments of cloth and leather; the doors of the other five gape wide.
5. Rusting manacles cruelly set high up on the walls hint at the suffering of those incarcerated here. A skeleton lies beneath each set.
6. Water covers the cell's floor. Bones jut from the pool. 

### CRYPTS 



1. The carvings on this heavy stone sarcophagus have been deliberately defaced.
2. A rusting portcullis hangs from the ceiling. Nearby, its equally rusted mechanism has frozen solid. The portcullis is all but immovable; however, if a character manages a prodigious act of strength the mechanism screams loudly when operated.
3. Dusty offerings stand upon this tomb. The offering—dead flowers, an empty wine bottle and a tarnished silver coin —stands at the head of the tomb.
4. The corner of this plain sarcophagus has crumbled away giving a view of the web-choked bones and glimmering treasures lying within.
5. Burial niches—one above another—pierce the walls from floor to ceiling. Within each lies a pile of mouldering bones wrapped in a ceremonial burial shroud.
6. A faded mosaic comprising hundreds of shards of splintered, coloured bone depicts an unholy symbol sacred to the monastery's adherents. 





## MINOR EVENTS 



1. Grit and dust sift down from the ceiling.
2. A soft wind caresses the characters' faces; their unprotected light sources waver under the breeze's onslaught but do not go out.
3. The faint clang of metal striking stone reaches the characters' ears from somewhere in an unexplored portion of the complex.
4. An emancipated rat scuttles into sight from around a corner or out from under a pile of rubbish. When it spots the characters, it turns tail and flees the way it came.
5. A sudden chill settles over the group; the most paranoid or frightened character feels like someone just walked over their grave.
6. The clatter of stone or slate from elsewhere heralds a small collapse of masonry or the like.
7. T h e mo s t p a r a n o i d ( o r cautious) character hears faint chanting in a harsh, otherworldly language. The chanting is at the l i m i t o f t h e c h a r a c t e r ' s h e a r i n g a n d seems to come from deeper into the complex.
8. A faint chittering s o u n d s l o w l y ga t h e r s i n t o a deep moaning that emanates from an indeterminable and ever-shifting source.
9. A s l i v e r o f f a i n t luminescent light greets the party's eyes when they round a corner or enter a new area. Investigation reveals a small amount of faintly glowing lichen filling a d e e p c r a c k i n t h e opposite wall.
10. Thick growths of glistening greyish slime cling to the ceiling. At the party's approach, a small blob of the slime drops from the ceiling and splatters loudly on the floor.
11. Small, precariously balanced sculptures of interwoven bones stand at intervals along the corridor. At the party's approach—one after another—the piles loudly collapse.
12. The clatter and clack of bone on stone (or the shuffling tread of zombies) reaches the characters' ears from an unknown locale. The sound could be an illusion designed to scare intruders away, the tread of undead guardians or an echo of what once was. 





## TREASURES, TRINKETS & TRASH 

### TREASURES 



1. Caked in dried blood, viscera and dust, this shattered longsword's pommel and cross guard are wrought from pure silver. Symbols of honour, purity and goodness decorate the weapon's pommel.
2. A small pouch contains mostly normal silver and copper coins. However, three gold crowns—stamped front and back with the sigil of an unholy power—hide among the less valuable coins.
3. A small wooden coffer the size of a jewellery box holds nothing but dust and a plush red velvet lining. The box is lockable, and the key yet remains in the lock.
4. This yellowing bone whistle is festooned with ragged black and red feathers of indeterminable origin. If blown, the pipe emits a thin, high-pitched wailing sound that unsettles mindless undead hearing it.
5. This twisted slag of gold and silver was once a paladin's holy symbol. At its centre, fragments of the paladin's skull yet hold a fragment of her—now deranged—soul.
6. Hanging from a rotting earlobe this silver teardropshaped earring is covered in grime and viscera.
7. Untold years of wear have worn smooth the inscriptions on this thin ancient golden torc of once exquisite design.
8. With a jagged blade and overly large pommel, this silvered dagger seems out of place in its plain leather scabbard. The arcane runes for undead and destruction decorate the inside of the scabbard in silver thread and could bestow the dagger with temporary powers. 

### TRINKETS 



1. A discarded wrought iron holy symbol of the monastery's patron power hangs from a thin rusting chain wrapped around a piton hammered into the wall. The symbols swing slowly in the breeze and make a faint clinking sound when it strikes the wall.
2. Lying on the floor, still attached to a fragment of silver chain, this small platinum locket is hopelessly squashed.
3. Hacked in twain the two pieces of this golden oval heartshaped bowl lie at opposite ends of the room. Hurried investigations may overlook one of the pieces.
4. Hollow and pierced by many small holes this heavy mace's head has a compartment that can be filled with (un)holy water. (The water splatters any creature struck by the weapon.)
5. Facing the wall, a skull lies on the floor amid a pile of bones. Investigation reveals the skull's teeth had been replaced with a set of incredibly sharp iron false teeth.
6. A slender five-foot-long silver chain hangs from a thick leather collar sized for a large dog (or perhaps a slave). Dried blood covers the collar.
7. A battered shield lies on the floor, face down. It bears the sigil of a good-aligned faith and belonged to a young, crusading paladin. The local church would be delighted with its return—although the neophyte paladin's fate remains a mystery.
8. This crumpled, water-damaged scroll bears a foul and blasphemous prayer. The text also provides a clue—a passphrase or command word—which might prove useful later in the party's exploration. 

### TRASH 



1. A helm lies on its side on the floor. A huge rent pierces the rusting piece of armour, and the glimmer of white bone is clearly visible within.
2. This scroll of thinly cured human flesh once held a profane spell; now it is featureless. The sheet is so light even the gentlest breeze causes it to flutter and shift; paranoid adventurers may think it is haunted!
3. The ragged scraps of a prayer book lie about the floor. Much of the book is illegible, but a few key passages remain—and perhaps they give an insight or clue into the passphrase for a magical trap or secret door located elsewhere in the complex.
4. This set of four six-sided bone dice is etched with macabre images of torture. The dice are misshapen, hateful things.
5. Burnt fragments of studded leather armour have been wrapped up and thrust into a torch sconce.
6. Faintly inscribed words in a foul, otherworldly language are still evident on these scarps of burnt papyrus.
7. Mouldy and with a huge rent in the back, dried blood coats the inside of this black cowled robe. Yellow thread on the robe's chest picks out a blasphemous symbol.
8. A skeletal hand yet clutches the remains of this burntdown torch. The hand appears severed cleanly—perhaps by a powerful sword or axe blow.

# RUINED WIZARD' S TOWER 


## OUTSIDE THE TOWER 



1. Rubble and fallen masonry cover the ground surrounding the ruined tower. Some of the stones and chunks of masonry bear strange runes of obvious magical origin and intent. Knowledgeable characters can identify many of the runes as pertaining to defensive spells and enchantments.
2. The shattered remains of several gargoyles and other decorative features lie intermingled with the rubble and other debris surrounding the tower.
3. Sections of the tower's remaining walls are blackened and scorched as if exposed to intense heat. In places, the heat was so strong the stone is vitrified.
4. The grass, bushes and other vegetation around the tower have grown stunted and twisted. The berries on the bushes are a deep purple in colour and are much smaller than berries found on normal bushes.
5. A campfire amid the rubble shows where at least one previous set of explorers spent the night. The fire's embers are cold.
6. The shadow cast by the ruined tower seems deeper and more elongated and jagged than it should be even in the strongest midday sun. From certain angles, the shadow looks like a grasping claw crawling away from the ruin.
7. A preternatural silence hangs over the ruin. Nearby, no birds sing, and no animals scurry through the undergrowth. Even the wind seems strangely diminished as if it dares not blow over the tower's remains.
8. The ruin is unstable and small rocks and stones still occasionally fall from the crumbling edifice. Like occasional rain, the clatter of stones falling from above is sporadic, but strangely the tower never seems to diminish in size as a result of these falls.
9. Lying stark upon the ground, the bleached skeletons of previous explorers lie scattered about the tower's environs. Some clearly died violent deaths—broken and splintered bones being evident—while others seem to have no obvious cause of death.
10. A network of now weed-choked ditches and overgrown earthen banks surround the tower. From the air, a character skilled in the magical arts might realise the layout of the ditches and banks strongly resembles a symbol of protection used to ward off otherworldly threats. It is likely—given the damage to the surrounds— the symbol no longer functions (if it ever did).
11. A profusion of overly large flowers of purple, yellow and red hue grow in great clumps about the base of the ruined tower. Their ponderous petals nod gently in the breeze and the exotic scent of their pollen fills the air.
12. The skeletal remains of some vast winged beast lie about the tower's ruin. Huge bones also lie scattered across a wide swath of ground about the tower. 





## INSIDE THE TOWER 



1. Rubble, wind-blown leaves and the detritus of previous exploration and the like cover the floor. Bones lie amid the mess; some are merely the remains of animals who wandered into the tower while others are much larger and have clearly lain here for some time.
2. Broken, rotting furniture lies scattered about; other smaller remains—perhaps plates, mouldering books or other mundane items—hint at the functions of various rooms and are intermingled with the larger pieces of trash. Many of the pieces bear the wizard's personal sigil.
3. Iron torch sconces jut from the walls. Of various esoteric designs, some are wrought to resemble skeletal arms while others appear to resemble the arms and claws of terrible, otherworldly beings. A few are in the shape of various forbidden magical runes.
4. In places, rotting oaken wainscotting hangs from the walls while in others its remains litter the floor. Several missing panels once concealed (now revealed and empty) secret storage niches and the like. Perhaps some of the remaining panels yet conceal similar niches.
5. Esoteric symbols decorate the risers of the stairs linking the tower's various levels. As the stairs rise through the tower, the character of the symbols becomes darker and more unknowable. Magical traps could yet lurk among these symbols. Others could hide dusty, undisturbed storage niches perhaps containing a hidden treasure.
6. Dusty, water damaged tapestries hang from the walls. None of the tapestries depicts normal, mundane scenes. Instead, they show horrible otherworldly monsters and grim planar scenes of destruction and slaughter.
7. The remains of a large wooden bookshelf, pulled away from the wall and smashed, cover the floor with shards of soft, mouldering wood. Intermingled with the mess, perceptive characters find the rotting remains of several books all rendered worthless and unreadable by time and weather. The faded titles on some of the covers—The Demonomicon, On the Art and so on—are just legible.
8. Small sections of stonework appear to have been melted by splatters of some kind of powerful acid or other chemical agent. It looks like the splatters descend one wall before crossing the floor for a short distance.
9. A faint, unplaceable odour hangs in the air, and seemingly resists dissipation by any wind or airflow short of hurricane-strength winds. The smell is reminiscent of a wet dog or cat.
10. The shattered remains of two glass vials lie scattered about the floor. In one place, it looks like the glass shards have been crushed into nothing more than fragments by something heavy. A skilled tracker may be able to make out a single footprint among the crushed glass.
11. The shattered remains of alchemical equipment— smashed test tubes, retorts, and the like—lie scattered about the floor. The trash is quite deep; this might be a good place to find a lost treasure.
12. The remains of a stuffed owlbear lean against one wall. The creature is huge and has been posed with its arms outstretched as if it were about to pounce. The creature is now mouldy, missing many of its feathers, and looks in a sorry state. Paranoid characters may think the creature is an animated guardian (and they could be right…)
13. A large tripod, supporting a gong almost cleaved in two, leans drunkenly against a wall. The gong's hammer— similarly broken in two—lies on the other side of the chamber. Careful examination of the hammer's head and the gong reveal small sections of scorched metal.
14. Many pieces of burnt and scorched parchment swirl about the chamber, caught in the grip of an unseen and unnatural breeze. The breeze emanates from the floor in roughly the centre of the swirling mass of parchment.
15. A large niche in an external wall once held a small forge connected to the outside by a short length of bronze chimney. The forge has been comprehensively shattered, but a short length of the aged bronze chimney—now green with verdigris—still precariously clings to the wall.
16. A pile of broken furniture, fallen masonry and the like partially block access to the next area the characters try to enter. It looks like the pile has been placed here— perhaps as a rudimentary breastwork.
17. Carved into the floor in the centre of the room are the words, “The blade overcame the art”, in Common. Unperceptive characters or those moving quickly might miss the small carven words.
18. An arrow slit or window pierces an external wall. A rusting grappling hook is wedged upon the sill. Outside, a short length of rotting rope hangs from the grapnel. Characters investigating the rope note it has been cut— the ends are not frayed—which hints at foul play.
19. Dried blood covers the floor and wall. In the midst of the blood lies the cold, but not yet decomposed body of an orc (or other humanoid appropriate to the setting). Strangely, the orc wears only a loincloth. In death, its face is twisted into a savage snarl. A strange, acrid odour rises from the corpse.
20. A jagged sword blade protrudes from a gap in the wall or floor between two closely set stones. Distracted characters could walk into the blade and injure themselves Of the sword's hilt there is no sign in the immediate vicinity, but the characters find it in the next area they explore. Its pommel was clearly once set with precious gems—several small empty holes show where they once glimmered. 





## LINGERING SPELL EFFECTS 



1. A small globe of darkness hovers in mid-air. Faint wisps of shadow drift from the globe to seemingly evaporate as they float away on a faint breeze. The temperature is noticeably cooler, in the vicinity of the globe.
2. A silvery rune graven into the floor still gives off a faint glow, which is practically undetectable in daylight but obvious in dim or darker light.
3. Shadows move and shift in the corner of the characters' eyes but disappear or stop moving when looked at. The shadows are of a variety of shapes and sizes; perceptive characters n o t i c e s e v e r a l o f t h e shadows have deeper spots that look disturbingly like eyes.
4. Heatless yellow flames dance a b o u t a n o r n a t e c r y s t a l chandelier hanging from the cracked ceiling in the centre of the room.
5. A permanent unseen servant, its magic now fading, yet haunts the tower. It continues to mindlessly try to tidy the tower; in its vicinity small objects move, dust gets blown about and so on. Some characters might believe the tower is haunted, as a result.
6. Scattered shards of a crystal ball lie about the floor; much of the crystal is shattered into tiny f r a gme n t s . A f e w l a r g e fragments remain, however; within them, faint eddies of mist yet swirl in suggestive patterns.
7. A permanent magic mouth programmed to greet visitors r e m a i n s functional. It bids guests welcome and warns them against entering certain areas unaccompanied.
8. Characters entering this area are struck with a feeling of nameless dread—the lingering vestige of a permanent fear spell placed here to keep intruders away from a hidden treasure. (The hidden treasure may—or may not be—still present.) 





## STRANGE SIGHTS & SOUNDS 



1. Cut into the wall, a glowing rune—etched in pale red light—provides faint illumination, akin to that of a candle. A careful examination of the rune reveals the light to be gently pulsating. Characters steeped in arcane lore can identify the rune as the wizard's personal sigil.
2. Glimmering motes of multi-coloured light drift gently on a faint breeze. Feather-light they can be blown or pushed about, but disappear if they touch anything.
3. The faint scent of burning or scorched flesh hangs in the air and stubbornly refuses to dissipate. The smell is particularly strong in areas featuring scorched and blackened stone.
4. The faint suggestion of chanting—screeched in a highpitched desperate tone—reach the party's ears. The chanting seems to come from a higher floor in the tower. This is an echo of the wizard's final spell. The chanting ends in choking sounds that trails away into nothingness.
5. Wisps of mist—glimmering with a soft effulgence—drift down the stairs from the wizard's laboratory or library. Investigations reveal the wisps are emerging from a dented iron cauldron of odd construct. The cauldron is empty, but the wisps continue to emerge as long as the cauldron is within the tower.
6. The temperature suddenly drops to freezing. Ice forms quickly on any metal or stone surface. Moments later, the temperature rises far above boiling and the ice steams away in mere seconds before the temperature returns once again to normal.
7. Birds swoop and dive about the tower, but none land on its crumbling structure; something seems to repel them from its surrounds. Sometimes when the birds swarm in vast numbers, their calls and squarks can reach near cacophonous levels.
8. The characters repeated hear the same sound, as they explore the tower. It could be chucking, crying, screaming, whispering or something else entirely. Wherever they go in the ruin the sound follows them but seems to come from nowhere in particular.
9. Insubstantial figures move about the tower, reenacting their last actions therein. They take no notice of the characters and act as if the tower was in perfect condition. This could mean they ascend missing stairs, walk through doors long since decayed and fallen or use objects and furniture no longer present in the tower.
10. A tiny rippling curtain of black energy covers part of a wall. The darkness is a portal to the wizard's extradimensional storage space. It is too small for most characters to enter, but a brave adventurer putting their hand inside might be able to grope about and recover a lost treasure. 





## LOST TREASURES 



1. An old platinum coin lies amid the dust and grime of the tower. So old it is almost worn smooth it is a remnant of an ancient, fallen evil empire imprinted with the insane, broken psyche of an elder lich.
2. A tightly wound scroll contains the wizard's first musing on the subject of lichdom and the steps that might be necessary to begin the transformation. The research is at a very early stage but nevertheless provides important insights into the process (and perhaps the author's state of mind).
3. A crescent moon sigil decorates the hilt of this finely wrought silver dagger. The weapon rests snuggly in a wolf-fur scabbard.
4. Four belt pouches festoon this surprisingly well preserved wide leather belt. The pouches contain an array of material components for common low-level spells along with a vial filled with silver dust worth 25 gp.
5. Hanging in the remains of a cupboard or wardrobe this once fine, now dusty and dirty, red robe clearly once belonged to a wizard who wanted to be identified as such. It has a deep cowl and wide sleeves. Small pockets —deep enough to hold a coin or small spell component— pierce the inner hem of each sleeve.
6. Three sturdy clay vials each etched with the same magical rune fill a small wooden box. Ornately carved with magical symbols, the box has three sections each perfectly sized to take one of the vials. Whatever the vials contain, they are clearly a set.
7. Decorated with jagged lightning bolt sigils, woven into and among other protective sigils these supple, leather bracers are fine enough to be imbued with magic.
8. Carved from basalt rock, this beautiful statuette of a horned owl has a deep crack running down its body. This statuette is a figurine of wondrous power (serpentine owl), but the damage it has suffered reduces the duration of its transformation by half.
9. Rolled up, and hidden under other detritus and rubbish, a five-foot square black rug hides from the casual glance of treasure hunters. A gleaming silver pentagram pattern decorates the rug. Characters wise in arcane lore can identify the pentagram as one designed to confine a summoned creature.
10. Covered in dust and grime, this hand-sized prism radiates faint divination magic. Investigations reveal the prism is enchanted to reveal the presence of magic but has a range of only about two-foot. It is useful for examining magical items, but less useful when used to search for magical traps.
11. An ornate crystal hourglass lies under a table. It is in surprisingly good condition. The multi-coloured sand takes one hour to drain from one chamber to the other.
12. Stone stoppers fill both ends of this overly wide and long, hardened leather scroll tube. The tube feels empty, but a character opening it discover three quills of fine enough quality for use in writing scrolls and spellbooks. The feathers—beautifully multi-coloured things that shimmer in the light—come from a couatl. 





# SEEDY TAVERN 


## THINGS TO SEE IN THE COMMONS 



1. Two men sit at a table drinking. As the evening progresses their conversation gets increasingly heated. Eventually, one of the men slams his empty flagon down on the table and storms out of the tavern.
2. A drunk half-orc totters through the crowd in search of the privy. He suddenly stops and throws up on the floor. Cheers and laughter greet this event.
3. A scantily clad woman leaps to her feet and throws a drink into the face of the man with whom she was sitting. With a splutter and roar he staggers to his feet, but the woman is faster—and darts off through the crowded common room.
4. A half-dozen drinkers sit around a table playing a complicated dice-based gambling game. Many empty flagons stand upon the table; as the evening progresses the drinkers get more and more raucous.
5. A near-destitute man (if his garb is anything to go by) sits morosely at a table nursing his drink. At his feet lies a miserable-looking, scrawny dog of indeterminate breed.
6. A small gang of rough and ready men and women enter the common room and all surge toward the bar at the same time. All of them are armed, and all seem slightly worse for wear.
7. An old man dressed in rags moves from table to table offering to tell fortunes for only one silver coin. The man has a modicum of power and offers a surprisingly prescient—if garbled—description of an important event or encounter in the party's near future.
8. A drunk man sitting alone at a table roars for another flagon of wine. When one appears, he tries to fondle the serving wench bring it to him. She slaps him across the face before flouncing away.
9. A wide and impressively muscled dwarf sits alone at a table by the wall. He seems to be drinking, but a perceptive watcher realises he is actually stone-cold sober…and watching the other patrons intensely.
10. A small group of patrons suddenly break into a rowdy (and obscene) drinking song. The song ends with roars and drunken cheering.
11. A well-dressed man is in deep, intense conversation with two heavily armed women. They, however, seem bored and keen to leave. The man is oblivious and continues talking, becoming more and more animated as they get more and more bored.
12. A small child wanders into the tavern and slowly looks around the common room before leaving.
13. After a short conversation, an attractive, scantily clad woman leads a drunken merchant from the tavern. Neither returns. (In fact, the woman is a thief and leads the besotted merchant outside to be mugged.)
14. Shouting from the bar draws everyone's attention to a heavily scarred warrior—hand on sword hilt—demanding credit. The landlord stands behind the bar shaking his head from side to side.
15. Two men arm wrestle at a table surrounded by a crowd of onlookers. Eventually, one man loses and much silver changes hands among the watching crowd.
16. As the characters sit drinking a man totters up to their table and asks—surprisingly politely—if they would lend him some money. His clothes proclaim him a manual worker of sorts, and he seems desperate for the money.
17. Raised voices at the bar, herald an argument quickly spirally out of control. Before it can come to (proper) blows several regulars step in and bundle the two arguers outside.
18. A man sits alone—his head on the table surrounded by several empty wine flagons. Perceptive watchers notice one of the serving wenches relieve the man of his pouch.
19. A tall, muscular man enters the bar, and suddenly everyone stops talking. He surveys the crowd before picking an empty table and calling for wine. Gradually, the mood in the common room returns to normal.
20. A hooded figure sits alone in a shadowy corner. If approached, he spins a clever tail of needing adventurers to carry a parcel to an associate who waits just outside town. This is—of course—a trap; the man only talks to the characters once they've been drinking for several hours and his associates wait outside for the marks to stumble into their ambush. 





## THINGS TO SEE IN A TAVERN BRAWL 



1. A brawler tips over a table. Atop the table lies a small pile of coins—the pot of some game now unattended. 2d20 cp and 2d10 sp clatter to the floor. Nearby brawlers dive for the coins and try to gather up as many as possible.
2. A brawler kicks over a bench, chair or table. The next person who isn't a character, to move through the square trips over it and falls prone.
3. A brawler tries to punch a target, misses and smashes a beer keg. Beer gushes out, creating a 15 ft. cone of slick floor. The innkeeper wails at this unfortunate event.
4. A random brawler hurls a flagon or chair at a character.
5. A small contingent of the watch arrives to break up the brawl. They use nonlethal attacks to subdue the brawlers, beating them with the ends of their spears. Brawlers fight to get away from the watch as no one wants to get arrested.
6. A brawler leaps onto the bar and starts to kick half-full flagons of beer into the melee. Every time he scores a hit he shouts in triumph.
7. Someone shouts that the watch is coming. At that, many of the brawlers make a break for the nearest exit. The area around the front and back doors of the tavern gets congested as patrons fight each other to getaway.
8. One brawler throws another 1d2 x 5 ft. onto a chair or table. The piece of furniture collapses and the thrown brawler lands prone.
9. Somehow, high-strength alcohol (such as brandy) lands in the fire. All combatants within 5 ft. suffer 1 fire damage as the fire sparks and spits.
10. The innkeeper (or another staff member) gets attacked by a brawler. The innkeeper shouts for help; if a character assists him, they gets free board and lodgings for one week.
11. Three brawlers gang up on another patron and quickly kick him to the floor. They beat him unconscious in two rounds before moving onto another target.
12. Desperate to escape the violence, a patron dives under a table and screams for help. The man is well-dressed and gives his rescuer a reward of 2 gp.
13. Skirting the violence, a patron moves from table to table quickly stealing coins, downing drinks and so on. After three rounds of this, he is spotted and attacked by irate patrons keen to teach him a lesson.
14. A large brawler picks up a bench and belts nearby targets with it. Once he has knocked unconscious a few other brawlers, the rest avoid him and he goes in search of new targets. He settles on the nearest character.
15. A female patron jumps onto the back of a brawler and starts hitting him over the head with a flagon. It smashes, blinding him for one round with ale. In the next round, he pulls her off and throws her to the floor.
16. A table collapses dumping the patron on it onto the floor. The patron falls prone.
17. A patron dives behind the bar and grabs several bottles of brandy or other expensive beverage. On the next round, they make a break for the door with their loot.
18. The fight spills out into the street as several brawlers fall through the tavern's door.
19. A brawler is thrown through a window or door into the street. Three rounds later, the watch arrives.
20. Amid the chaos, a thief rifles the pouch of a fallen brawler. If no one stops him, he moves onto his next mark. If accosted, he flees. 

## BRAWL TRIGGERS 



1. A drunk staggers against a table sending drinks flying. Those around the table attack the drunk, furious at his clumsiness. The drunk's friends leap to his aid...
2. An argument erupts at one table and quickly several patrons are fighting. The brawl is a diversion; one of the other customers (perhaps even a character) is marked for assassination and while the fight distracts witnesses the assassin strikes.
3. A pickpocket fails spectacularly to lift a purse. The owner notices and tries to grab the thief. He twists out of the man's hands but falls into a nearby table, spilling the drinks on it.
4. A drunk man staggers to the bar and demands more ale. The barkeep refuses and the man gets belligerent. A regular steps in to defuse the situation and the drunk attacks him. As the regular staggers back, he knocks over another man who leaps to his feet enraged. From there, the chaos quickly spreads...
5. A prostitute is seeking business. Two drunken men begin to argue over who should enjoy the pleasure of her company first. She draws the two men into a brief bidding war, which ends with one smashing a flagon over the other's head.
6. A server weaves through the taproom with a full tray of drinks. However, when she sets it down, two groups of drinkers claim that the drinks are for them. Both groups are drunk and the ensuing argument turns violent. 





## STRANGE THINGS BEHIND THE BAR 



1. An oversized dagger—more the size of a short sword— with a wickedly serrated blade hangs behind the bar. The tip of the weapon is missing. The weapon once belonged to a hill giant and is poorly made; a local claimed to have slain the giant and swapped the dagger for a month of free drinking.
2. A dusty glass bottle stands on a pedestal in a niche high up behind the bar. Cobwebs cover the bottle and the label is faded and unreadable. Local lore has it that as long as the bottle remains full, good fortune will befall the tavern and its owner.
3. A battered hat of strange design and appearance rests on one of the ale barrels behind the bar. The yellow felt hat has a red brim and a large ragged hole—where the wearer's forehead would be.
4. A cage stands on the counter behind the bar. A single, obviously malnourished and agitated, stirge lurks in the cage. Anyone who tries to leave without paying, or who molests one of the servers, is forced to thrust a hand through the bars to feed the creature. Shockingly, there is little violence and few disturbances in this tavern.
5. An array of battered and hacked shields decorate the back wall of the bar. They hang from wooden pegs and sometimes the staff rearrange them (for no apparent reason). A few of the shields are plain wooden affairs, but most bear heraldic devices. Present are the symbols of several nearby humanoid tribes along with the devices of five adventuring bands (two of which were wiped out during their adventures).
6. A collection of fine and delicate goblets and wine glasses cluster thickly upon a narrow shelf lined with faded yellow cloth. The innkeeper never lets anyone use the glasses—saying they are for “quality” customers only. What he means by this is anyone's guess. When the inn is quiet he often takes the various glasses down and polishes them carefully.
7. A yellowing giant's skull hangs from the ceiling over the bar. Burning candles set in the eye sockets give the whole thing an eerie appearance.
8. Copper coins fill a metal bucket behind the bar. Customers are encouraged to throw their spare coppers into the bucket. At the end of the month, the owner distributes the coins to his staff (or perhaps local needy children). He may—or may not—be skimming off the top.
9. A portrait of the current king or other local ruler stares down haughtily over the bar. The barkeep is particularly patriotic and does not brook any unkind words about the portrait's subject. People uttering such thoughts are refused service.
10. A tapestry hangs down behind the bar, completely obscuring the wall. The tapestry is one of several the tavern possesses, and every now and then the barkeep replaces it with another. Some of the tapestries are worn and faded, while others are almost brand new. The owner will pay good gold for new additions to his collection. (Unbeknownst to the customers—and most of the staff—the tapestry covers several secret viewports in the wall the owner uses to spy on his customers; each new tapestry has small holes cut in it over these holes.)

## SEEDY TAVERN PATRONS 



1. Quobbis Quibble (LN male gnome): A fat gnome with buck teeth fidgets in supreme discomfort as he constantly looks around the room. Judging by his fine clothes, he shouldn't be within a hundred yards of this “fine” establishment.
2. Sibolen Itali (N male elf): A drunk elf with long black hair crawls on the floor, searching for something he has lost (his wedding band).
3. Ginger Greybeard (CN male dwarf): A deeply tanned and extremely boisterous dwarf mocks his opponent, then swigs another mug of beer in a drinking contest. The amber liquid bubbles in his beard.
4. Urul (NE female orc): Two sharp tusks protrude from the hood of a figure in a shadowy corner; investigations reveal the individual to be an orc!
5. Cham (CE female halfling thief 3): A young halfling relieves a very drunk patron of his coin purse before retreating under a table to inspect his prize.
6. Petrera Malice (LE female human fighter 2): A tall woman in black leather armour sits at attention at the bar. She refuses a drink from the server and keeps a hand on her longsword.
7. Gullun (CN male halfling): A halfing at the counter produces acrid smoke from a yellow pipe. His eyes are haunted and distant, his body paralysed in remembrance of some terrible past event.
8. Kayvan Lorrick (CG male half-elf wizard 2): A drunk halfelf summons and dispels magical light morosely at his table. Every few moments, his hand goes to a bruise on his face.
9. Gerard Burnheap (CE male half-orc fighter 3): A half-orc downs mug after mug in angry determination. His muscles are alive with malcontent, and he looks around the room for someone to fight.
10. Yorik Greygal (CN male dwarf): A very short dwarf slumps passed out on his table amongst a dozen mugs. The look of serene content upon his face is enviable.
11. Bayran Lorrick (CN male half-elf): An animated half-elf flirts with the female patrons of the bar. His green eyes sparkle with every laugh he procures, though the other customers look annoyed.
12. Grom (NG male human): A man at least eight feet tall hunches over a table, beer stein clutched awkwardly in massive hands.
13. Davian Derrows (N male human cleric 2): A cleric of the dominant local faith reviews paperwork by candlelight. He smiles graciously at the server and accepts another drink before returning to work.
14. Sacha Devree (NE female gnome): A thin gnome with heterochromia has lost her left hand to a skin disease. She winces in pain through every mouthful of mead.
15. Horne (LN male elf): A white-haired young elf speaks quietly to a shrouded confidant. The barkeep brings out expensive liquor for the pair and refuses payment.
16. Velia Omrick (CN female human): The barkeep brings out a whole roasted chicken to a child of eight or nine, who pays with a strange gold coin. The girl devours the chicken within minutes.
17. Hodrin Bleakfire (CN male dwarf): A bald dwarf regales an inattentive crowd with his dragon-slaying exploits. Judging by his seared armour, there may actually be truth to this story.
18. Hurdle Belch (NE female halfling): A morbidly obese halfling slips in and out of consciousness as she totters in her chair, mumbling nonsense to herself.
19. Filth (CN male gnome): An ancient gnome begs coppers from other customers. His pleas are answered with laughs, grunts or swats.
20. Petrar Mane (LG male human paladin 1): A bright-eyed young human in shining full plate looks incredibly out of place here. He listens attentively to the conversations around him and seems eager—but hesitant—to join in. 





## SEEDY TAVERN STAFF 



1. Eelred Vine (CE male elf): The green-eyed, yellowhaired elf behind the counter is handsome, smiling and totally self-absorbed. He steals glances at his own reflection whenever possible.
2. Gerey Tere (N male human): The man who serves drinks is mute. His tongue has been cut out and cruel scarring mars his cheeks.
3. Rida (N female half-elf): The dexterity of this onehanded server is impressive, though why someone so skilled would work in a dump like this is a mystery.
4. Thori Ghoststone (CG female dwarf): This dwarf bartender is bald. She wears large stone earrings and heavy makeup, and she speaks in a thick difficult-toplace accent.
5. Gyles and Gunder Keson (CN male gnome): The two gnome servers are identical twins, though one suffers from a severe limp in his left leg.
6. Berter Crimson (NG female half-orc): Intricate tattoos run up the arms of this half-orc server, spilling into black fractals on her stern face.
7. Willom (CE male half-orc): This half-orc bartender surreptitiously spits into the drinks of those he doesn't like. Regulars know this and are not taken in by his innocent smile, full of sharpened teeth.
8. Aldwulf (LE male human): Some rough blade removed the bartender's nose many years ago. The nasal cavity drips grey mucus.
9. Renda Hurn (NE female human): An eyepatch hangs loosely across the bartender's gaunt face. Peeling skin and exposed bone indicate some sort of burn wound.
10. Charder Whancey (CN male halfling): This halfing bartender is a jovial fellow who stands out from the crowd in his dirty pink suit. He stands on a stool to speak to his customers.
11. Gery Blank (LN male human): The portly man behind the counter looks more like a monk than a bartender. He extols the virtues of beer and brewing to a customer who is quite obviously asleep.
12. Jin (LG male half-elf): A half-elf child of no more than ten years serves behind the bar. He cleans and distributes mugs expertly, and the patrons treat him with great and obvious respect.
13. Maco Mills (CG male gnome): The gnome behind the counter does the work of two men, expertly using magic to clean dishes and grab dirty mugs from afar.
14. Hamse Gamen (CE male halfling): The halfling bartender is more inebriated than the patrons. Instead of the house swill, he takes long swigs from a silver flask at his breast pocket.
15. Gnome (CN female human): The scars across the face of this nameless gnome server seem intentional, almost ritualistic in nature.
16. Roguy Mulk (CN male halfling): The halfing server runs around the room, struggling to refill glasses and take orders. Even during lulls, he is always behind.
17. Gileon Hoptt (CG male human): The serving boy, a handsome teenage boy with a ponytail, constantly eavesdrops on patrons and offers his own advice on private affairs.
18. Bari Brokenrock (CN male dwarf): The overweight dwarf bartender won't stop talking. Since nobody is listening he talks to himself, gesticulating wildly as he cleans a mug.
19. Anzi (CE female human): The server has one false eye, a black marble that twitches with a life of its own.
20. Reyna Evergreen (CG female human): The serving girl tosses orders on the table carelessly, then returns to cleaning her nails with a knife. She radiates disinterest. 





## THINGS LEFT IN A BEDCHAMBER 



1. A small, half-full vial of woman's perfume is wedged between the bed and the wall. The glass vial is intricately made and worth 10 gp. The perfume is worth an additional 5 gp and smells of lilac and roses.
2. Several pieces of rubbish have been pushed under the bed. A tray holding a plate of mouldering food covers a piece of smudged parchment. It looks like the parchment once depicted a map, but a great smear has rendered it unreadable.
3. A muted red cloak hangs on a hook on the back of the door. Dried mud clings to the cloak's hem and a large rip pierces its back.
4. The previous occupant of this room was paranoid and slept with a (normal) dagger under his pillow. Sadly, he forgot it when he left. The blade is small, light and wickedly sharp.
5. The initials CB and CRB are deeply carved into the bed's battered headboard.
6. A large bloodstain mars the bedsheets. A blanket covers the stain from casual view, but a character getting into bed without checking first could be in for a shock.
7. An empty wine flask lies on the floor by the bed. A perceptive character smelling the flask might detect a subtle, but definitely out of place, odour.
8. A wooden shield leans against one wall; it's in poor condition, with several gouges hacked out of its surface. The shield's strap is worn and frayed. If used in combat, the strap snaps after three rounds.
9. A rat—its back broken—lies on the floor, squeaking pitifully. The rat's injuries look like someone has intentionally stamped on it before leaving it to suffer and die. If a character heals the rat, it becomes a loyal pet (or it could be so much more—perhaps a wizard's familiar, a polymorphed adventurer and so on).
10. A wine-stained, frayed tunic rolled up in a ball lies in one corner where it was tossed. The garment stinks and is sized for an obviously overweight human (or perhaps a half-orc).
11. A frayed sock lies under the bed.
12. A pile of folded blankets stands on a sideboard against one wall. A letter—a love letter speaking of forbidden love—has fallen behind the pile. One of the lovers—a prominent member of the community—is mentioned in the letter; apparently, she must never find out about this relationship...
13. A small soft leather pouch containing three small black stones (onyx worth 10 gp each) has been stuffed into a pillow. The pouch is embroidered with initials, “J.P.L” and is of fine quality.
14. A blood-stained scrap of fabric lies in the shadows under a sideboard. It looks like it was used to clean off a dagger or similar weapon.
15. A note pinned to the back of the door reminds the occupant to lock the door when retiring for the night because of “the regrettable incident last month.”
16. Small flakes of metal lie under the room's door. Careful investigation of the lock reveals it's been tampered with. Even if the key is turned in the lock, the lock doesn't actually engage; thus the door is not locked (even though the occupant believes it to be secured properly).
17. A dreary watercolour hanging from the wall depicts a local landmark on a particularly bleak day. A waterproof pouch tacked to the back of the painting holds a map of a cellar. Although the location of the cellar is not shown, a link to a nearby sewer is clearly visible.
18. A small wardrobe in one corner of the room holds a hooded cloak forgotten by the previous occupant. The cloak is voluminous and fur-lined and worth 20 gp. Unfortunately, it is a distinctive light blue in colour and its owner is actively looking for it.
19. While in bed, a perceptive character may notice strange etchings on the ceiling directly overhead. When a light source is placed at the end of the bed on a small occasional table, the flickering shadows create a map on the ceiling.
20. Graffiti scratched into the wall by the door holds the following, unsettling message, “Curse the unending scrabbling. Beware the rats in the walls." 








# SHADOWED BORDERLAND 



## BORDERLAND DRESSINGS 



1. A boar limps from the underbrush, snorting and whining. The arrow protruding from its hind legs is of strange design and seemingly carved of stone. Black veins radiate from the wound, indicating infection or worse.
2. Two brown rabbits are caught in a hunter's trap. Judging by the rabbits' emaciated condition, they have been here for some days. Strangely, no larger predators have come along to claim this prize. A sense of foreboding surrounds the area.
3. A deaf old man invites the party to share his fire. Beyond this simple gesture, he makes no attempt to communicate or provide food. Indeed, he grows increasingly erratic the longer the party stays, culminating in a violent fit of silent anger.
4. A terrified stallion bolts across the party's path, oblivious to its surroundings. If the horse is caught and calmed, its saddlebags provide some coins and food, but no clues as to the owner's fate. A strange brand is seared into the horse's jaw, and it is fresh.
5. A rider dressed in unusual clothes emerges from the brush, waiving an ornate bronze dagger above her head. She speaks in an incomprehensible language, but shouts at the party with some urgency. Cold sweat drips from her face. Frustrated, she canters off down the road.
6. A fresh corpse sprawls on the side of the road. No injuries are apparent, but her expression is one of extreme shock. The eyes within her head have turned to bronze, and the coins within her purse are iron. She holds a blank scrap of parchment in a curled hand.
7. A discarded doll lies face down on the ground. It is of fine make, and well-loved, but has been discarded for some time. Burn marks line the doll's dress, and lice crawl through its hair. The toy is warm to the touch and oddly soft.
8. The party passes a rough-hewn statue of a crying woman. Judging by the quality of the work, this may have been the passion project of an unskilled labourer. Trees and vines partially cover the stone, drinking life from the dew collecting on the statue's face. Despite its hurried craftsmanship, the statue conveys a sense of utter loss.
9. A haunting song is warped by the breeze. The lyrics are of a dead language, but the tone is obviously mournful. The tune distorts as the party approaches until it is nothing but a discordant howl of wind through a shattered stone. As the party leaves the stone, the song begins again.
10. A nervous merchant approaches the party and offers his wares—mostly torn clothing and cheap jewellery. He displays these in frenetic bursts, scratching his skin and chattering incessantly. While he offers many items, he does not offer his name. As the encounter drags on, the man grows increasingly agitated, eventually fleeing from the party in terror.
11. An emaciated woman stands in a field, arms outstretched to the heavens. She recites funerary hymns and stares unblinkingly at the sun. She is blind and deaf to the party and lapses into brooding silence if restrained.
12. Three hangman's nooses dangle from a tree. There's no sign of a scuffle, only a feathered cap discarded on the ground. Further down the road, the ground is sprinkled with green arrows. None have found their mark.
13. Three riders approach. They are armoured as if for war, and their mounts are barded. They give the party a wide berth as they pass, too far for any sort of detailed scrutiny. Should the party approach, the riders draw their weapons and flee.
14. Wolves howl in the distance. Judging by their calls and cadence, they are stalking injured prey. The chase continues for several minutes until an abrupt about-face. From over the horizon echo the whimpers and whines of wolves in pain.
15. Throughout the night, torches and campfires refuse to stay lit. Strong gusts blow them out, sudden deluges extinguish them or they simply gutter and die of their own accord. Even magical lights seem to flicker, uncertain of their strength.
16. Giant tracks of some beast or humanoid cross the party's path. The markings are unusual—seven toes, claws and an uneven number of legs. The creature was dragging something nearly as large as itself; tarry black blood obscures some of the tracks.
17. A fresh corpse hangs from a tree, riddled with arrows— flies feast in the various gashes of its skin. Many mutilations took place after the unfortunate victim's passing. This is clearly a warning for other travellers.
18. Hot, stifling mist rolls over the landscape, smelling of sweetness and sharp lye. The air is deadened into silence, but blood pounds in the party's ears. Even flowers wilt and insects go silent. The feeling of suffocation is nearly unbearable, and the mist does not pass for several hours.
19. By morning, dusty cobwebs festoon the camp. They infest armour, packs and even the inside of tents. Shrivelled spiders litter the ground, but no living arachnids survive to greet the morning.
20. Ragged horns sound in the distance. By the time the party arrives, they find boar hooves, blood splatters and stone weaponry of unknown make. Was this a mere hunting party? Or something far worse? 





## BORDERLAND LANDMARKS 



1. Split Tree: The trunk of this massive oak splits at the base, forming an enormous “V”. Ancient charred wood and twisted splinters suggest some act of violence broke the tree in twain.
2. Burbling Pond: This clear and inviting pond sits at the base of a rocky ravine. A constant stream of bubbles provides the only clue that something is amiss. The water is a deadly poison, though the effects can take hours or even days to manifest.
3. Merry Skeleton: Nobody knows who the corpse was, or where he came from. The merry skeleton sits by the side of the road, limbs twisted in a macabre pose. Travellers festoon him with red string and flowers, and some even leave coppers to pay for his continued good health.
4. Greyflower Fields: Large patches of grey flowers dot the hills. No bees or animals frolic in these fields, and the flowers' scent is of ash. Wanderers who camp in the fields experience leaden, dreamless sleep.
5. Black Cairn: This strange obelisk comprises shimmering black stone which reflects moonlight into rainbow prisms. By day, the stone radiates heat. By night, crystalline frost spirals down its spine. Tiny animals are found impaled by its barbs, though none know if they are trapped or placed here.
6. Forgotten Shrine: A small stone shrine lies in peaceful ruin by the road. Broken pieces of coloured glass from its once-fine windows suggest a cheerful patron god or spirit, but no symbol of divinity remains. Now, travellers leave their own tokens and prayers. The forgotten shrine holds a variety of statuettes and icons dedicated to an entire pantheon upon its tiny, crumbling pedestal.
7. Icewhip: The Icewhip comprises three jagged bluffs. Each ends in a sharpened edge upon which the wind splits and wails. These low peaks are the first to see winter's touch and the last to thaw. Even in summer, they can smoke with icy frost.
8. Widower's Hut: The widower is old beyond reckoning, and consumed by grief beyond reason. He emerges from his wooden shack to ask passers-by for news of “Valenta,” but barely comprehends their responses.
9. Witching Tree: Ancient carven runes decorate this redhued tree. Rumour holds the bark is stained from human blood. In any case, the thin black leaves rattle in the wind, and its creeping branches scrape the ground.
10. Moss Walls: On either side of a stream, a grid of charred stones poke from the mud. A weary traveller might be too hurried to see the pattern, but the Moss Walls are all that remains of a sprawling settlement. Charcoal and shattered stone speak to a violent end to the place.
11. Ruvian Column: A rough bas relief decorates this towering black marble obelisk. While wind and rain have eroded the details, the broad strokes are clear. The relief tells the story of the three-armed warriors, bearded and bristling, and their conquest of the region. The heroes face many monsters and armies and finally die after uniting the realm.
12. Echoing Well: This dizzying pit is just wide enough for a skinny man, but it splinters as it twists into the dark. Rough stones punctuate the walls, and some fearless explorer has carved handholds down one side. Shouting down the well yields an echo after several seconds, but the returning voice has a hollow, frightened tone.
13. Barrow Hills: These large, even hills extend for hundreds of meters in every direction. Red and orange flowers catch the light between pale blades of grass. Beneath the layers of fertile soil, chunks of granite are heaped together into mounds. What lies beneath the granite, who can say?
14. Broken Cage: This ruined web of iron bars was once a massive cage. Now, it sits broken at the base of a small ravine. The weather has worn and rusted the bars, reducing some to mere spikes. Judging by the cage's size, the prisoner must have been a giant.
15. Blinding Waterfall: This waterfall is little more than an orange stream trickling between two rocks. The liquid is extremely caustic. While the plants around have withered and died, desperate animals still try their luck. Bones litter the ground.
16. Giant's Pool: Out in the wastes, a grinning skull the size of a horse guards a small pool of water. Scattered nearby are a few vertebrae, teeth and other miscellaneous bones. Uneven horned growths riddle the skull, but the creatures who drink at this pool don't seem to mind.
17. Teetering Tower: The Teetering Tower should have fallen years ago. It leans heavily to the west, finding some purchase on a sickly willow that sprung up beside it. The remains of the top of the tower lie in a broken heap beyond the tree.
18. Lost Battleground: This empty field yields nothing upon first glance. A traveller, perhaps resting on the soft earth or setting up camp, may begin to notice signs of war. Arrowheads, rusted mail and fragmented bones poke up from the slick mud. To the west, hastily dug trenches and latrines marked the boundary of one army's camp. The longer the party stays on the battleground, the more the slimy ground feels like rotting flesh.
19. Crosswise: Two cobbled roads meet at the bottom of a rolling valley. A round stone marks the juncture. However, chisel-wielding vandals have erased any text on the stone, and the roads fade into nothingness after a dozen meters.
20. Rhycliff: This rocky ledge extends far over a deep gorge. From below, the Rhycliff looks like it should have fallen centuries ago. From the top, the uncertain slope threatens to lure unwary explorers over the edge. 





## BORDERLAND LEGENDS 



1. An ancient city fell to ruin when a blood feud spiralled out of control. The crumbled ruins can be found in the wastes, with treasure hidden within. But beware the symbols of the two rival factions: a sparrow and an oak.
2. Three thieves fled to the borderlands after their heist of the Carrion Ruby. After many days of hunger and thirst, one thief killed and ate the others. However, his hunger was not sated. In his delirium, he mistook the ruby for an apple and choked to death.
3. The peasant Ruthen was raised to the nobility after many heroic deeds. While he ventured to right the wrongs of the world, his sons became fat and wealthy. Disgusted, Ruthen buried his inheritance in a borderland cave and placed guardians to protect it.
4. The Last Priest wanders the borderland. He claims to be the last disciple of the First God, and only through him can the god live. He can bestow powerful blessings and is capable of undoing curses and prophecies.
5. The Blind Swordsman fought his final battle somewhere here among the rocks. Though he vanquished his opponent, he was dealt a grievous blow. His sword lies where fire springs from water.
6. It is terrible luck to light a campfire after the sun has set. Travellers should begin their fires before the sun sinks below the horizon, or not at all.
7. The borderlands house the secret crypts of all past kings and great rulers. They come here once their rules have ended to be buried with their kin.
8. Stay far away from the Penitent One. His guilt drove him to curse himself, and inflict terrible mutilations on his flesh. Now he stalks the borderlands, shouting his agony to the stars.
9. Travelling groups of five always see misfortune. It is better to begin a journey with four or six, or the borderlands will take one for its own.
10. An army of giants sleeps beneath the ground. Should too many travellers pass at once, the monsters may awaken and wreak havoc upon the world.
11. A tribe of wild men use the borderlands as a hunting ground. A child of this tribe does not become a man, until he has scalped a traveller and taken his horse.
12. The Icewhip (“Borderland Landmarks” #8) is the spinal ridge of a titanic sleeping dragon. It chills the air and draws magical auras into its orbit. A traveller who sleeps atop the Icewhip shares his dreams with the slumbering dragon below. 





## STRANGE BORDERLAND EVENTS 



1. The shadows are off today. Though the sun is high in the sky, the shadows run long, and at odd angles.
2. The maddening call of frogs and crickets build to an unnatural, undulating crescendo, then suddenly cease.
3. The distant wailing of a mournful song echoes across the plains. Or is it merely the wind?
4. A hunted bird is missing several of its organs, including its heart. It twitches even as it is being cooked over a campfire.
5. Strange rock pillars dot the landscape. They are balanced precariously but show no evidence of recent arrangement. Moss and lichen grow thickly over them.
6. Thin ice covers a pool of still black water. This unnerving mirror distorts the viewer's face into misshapen, shimmering fractals.
7. Large clumps of bloody fur dot the trail. No skin or flesh can be found, however.
8. Black earth spirals across the ground in demonic patterns. This seems to be a natural phenomenon but is still unnerving.
9. A rocky crag protrudes from the landscape. It featured prominently in the party's dreams the night before.
10. Worms squirm from the earth and towards the party. They do not attack or provide any sort of obstacle— rather, they are gripped with a suicidal impulse to be trampled underfoot.
11. Dry lightning cracks from cloud to cloud. As the storm builds, the lightning changes from white to blue to red.
12. At a fork in the road, a wooden sign has been meticulously vandalised. The smoking runes, too precisely wrought for casual creation, obscure the sign's original markings.
13. First one, then two, then a hundred ravens perch in the trees above the party. Without a sound, they watch the travellers. When the party leaves the grove, the ravens fall on mass lifeless from the canopy, landing with sickening thuds.
14. The campfire twists and gutters as if caught in a hurricane, though the night has barely a breeze.
15. The party's eyes turn black by the light of the campfire. Dawn returns them to their natural colours.
16. Through the twilight mists, the moon takes on a red and sickening hue. It seems to spin slowly in its journey, and an echoing dripping noise plagues the party all night.
17. The party come across a grisly scene—a pair of rabbits are stained red with blood. They seem to have eaten their young.
18. A kettle of vultures follows the party for days. When the group stops to rest, the carrion birds land within arm's reach, and posture as if claiming each body for their own. They fly away if threatened, only to return later to resume their vigil.
19. A week's worth of rations goes bad in an afternoon, turning to a thick and foul black sludge.
20. Thousands of rodent skeletons cover a nearby field. No predator can be found. If the characters investigate, a perfectly healthy mouse struggles to the top of the pile, quivers and dies. 





## STRANGE BORDERLAND FOLK 



1. Gravin Morningfall (NG male human fighter 3) is on a quest (though he refuses to state its goal). Grand and naive, with sparkling eyes and a winning grin, Gravin gladly invites travellers to his fire (if not his tent). After all, he travels with a small retinue of squires, cooks and porters. He is the fourth son of a wealthy aristocrat, born with a silver spoon in his mouth and dreams in his head.
2. Kurdu Ronz (N old male human thief 8) makes no secret of his past. He's an old thief on the run from the law, taken to the borderlands to escape the realms of men. While gruff and prone to curmudgeonly ranting, he clearly desires a target for his insults. He provides travellers with camp and food, provided they can withstand his moods. After the fire dwindles, he mumbles late into the night about his past successes (though many seem too fantastic to be true).
3. The Falconer (N male human ranger 5) is soft, rounded and smells of meat. In his fur hat and hide cloak, he seems acutely capable of living in the elements. He rides an ancient donkey at no more than a trot and refuses to dismount even in company. Atop his gloved arm is the source of his name—a golden falcon of majestic breed and stature. While the Falconer does not seek out travellers, he is not above offering a terse word of advice or tossing a scrap of rabbit over his shoulder as he takes his leave.
4. Elizan Fry (CN female human fighter 5) is on the run. She refuses to explain why, but the scars on her face paint a vivid picture nonetheless. Elizan is suspicious of strangers and only wanders from her cave in search of travelling merchants or news. Judging by the bow and daggers she carries, she can defend herself (and is not above a little light banditry).
5. Gran Batis (N middle-aged female human druid 3) is incredibly ugly. With a misshapen head, one sunken eye and missing teeth, Gran's features inspire fear and hate. Perhaps due to these deformities, Gran sought refuge in the borderlands. Now, she lives in moderate comfort as a healer and witch, where her horrifying face provides something of a credential. Gran is kind and smiling, but clearly wary of the way people treat her.
6. Dizanz Hardcloak (N male human fighter 1) and his family live on a homestead atop a short bluff. Barricades and spike pits make the approach slow, but not impossible. Dizanz is wary of, and sometimes violent toward, strangers, though if visitors show enough respect he may offer begrudging help. No traveller may enter his homestead, for the safety of his wife and three daughters. However, no one has actually seen his family for years.
7. Tharkan Shadowhand (CN male human cleric 2) worships forgotten gods—as many as he can, and at every chance he gets. This short, balding human claims he has the gift to speak with dead gods and receives minor blessings in exchange for a humble offered prayer. Tharkan is fat and jolly, all too willing to share a cup of wine and regale a traveller with a fanciful tale. His cave is a crowded mishmash of shrines, candles and animal sacrifices.
8. Franches Runard (CG male human fighter 1) is an artist and sculptor, as he will tell you in his lengthy introduction. He spends most of his time travelling from city to city, working for patrons and thrilling his viewers. When he runs out of inspiration, he heads to the borderland to fast and meditate. Despite Franches' flamboyant act, he knows how to survive on the borderlands. A dagger and chisel share adjacent scabbards at his waist.
9. Ulrich Cast (NG middle-aged male human ranger 2) is a hunter, severe and reserved. He is an older man, with white stubble and a shattered jaw that rolls to the left as he talks. Ulrich's quarry is something of a mystery. He refuses to share details, even to close friends. If his hard exterior is broken, Ulrich travels with the party for some time, bringing in game every night even in the depths of the borderlands.
10. Clifta Fenwick (CN female human wizard 8) has clearly lost her mind. She is, or was, a sorceress of some kind, and still possesses some of the spark. Now she wanders the borderlands, talking to herself, giggling and telling jokes without punchlines. Curiously, she does not seem to eat, drink or sleep, and animals avoid her. Only her filthy noble's clothes suggest her once proud station.
11. Jashai (NG old male human ranger 4) is the last member of his tribe. He is old now, with a wrinkled face and bent back, but his limbs are still strong. His village was attacked when he was just a boy, and Jashai has lived like a ghost on the borderlands ever since. The last of his people, Jashai is a font of novel stories and legends, as well as unique methods for trapping wild game.
12. Avara (LG female human cleric 7) meditates atop the Icewhip (“Borderland Landmarks” #8), in a small cave protected from the wind. Her famished frame is preserved by dripping water, mushrooms and sheer willpower. Avara has gained some status as a yogi and soothsayer back in civilisation. Many wealthy travellers come to lay laurels at her feet and seek her words of wisdom. In response to these gestures, Avara speaks her truths and continues her meditations. 





# SLAVERS' COMPOUND 



## DUNGEON DRESSING 



1. Four long leather whips hang from pegs driven into the wall. All four whips have dried blood on their tips and well-worn handles.
2. Two hoods without eye or mouth holes lie crumpled and discarded on the floor. Both are sweaty and obviously much used.
3. A chalkboard on the wall displays a complicated tally system. Clever characters divine the system relates to the various types of slaves the slavers keep in their pens.
4. A single smeared bloody handprint mars one wall.
5. A set of stocks stands in the centre of this chamber, on a raised dais. Several baskets of small rocks stand against one wall. Characters examining the baskets discover dried blood on many of the stones.
6. The stench of sweat and excrement hangs heavily in the air. The smell grows stronger the closer one gets to the slave pens.
7. One whitewashed wall has a price list of sorts daubed upon. The various kind of slaves—male, female, child, skilled and so on are all listed—along with their price. On closer inspection, the characters discover smudge marks suggesting the slavers change the price of their captives.
8. The faint smell of urine reaches the characters' nostrils. A suspiciously dark patch of the wall slightly further on indicates where someone has relieved themselves.
9. A large pile of rusting chains lies in a haphazard heap in one corner. Every set has either manacles or a neck collar attached. Twenty sets comprise the pile; perceptive characters searching it find a small hidden coffer containing a small coin trove. In total, the hoard comprises 123 cp and 49 sp.
10. The initials GH and FR are faintly chipped into a wall low down near the floor. The carving is small and probably done hurriedly.
11. A discarded pile of clothes lies in the corner. Investigations reveal the clothes belonged to several different people—they are of varying sizes and cuts. The clothes are filthy, ragged and infested with lice and fleas. Anyone searching through the clothes could become similarly infested.
12. Four thick books—the slavers' ledgers—fill a small shelf. Each book is chained shut and fitted with a padlock. The slaver leader carries the books' keys on his person at all times. The ledgers contain details of not only the slavers' everyday activities but also details of their far-flung agents and contacts.
13. Scattered drops of dried blood decorate the floor. The drops grow smaller and more indistinct the further away they are from the slave pens.
14. A brazier full of smouldering coals sits in a corner of the room. Several branding irons are thrust deep into the coals, their handles wrapped tightly with worn leather. The pokers are red hot and clearly ready for immediate use. Each has a differently designed head: one has a stylised V design, another features an H design and the final brand has an ornate Y design. A close examination of the brands reveals flesh burnt onto their heads.
15. A frayed tapestry depicting a high-sided ship with black sails wallowing in a heavy sea hangs from one wall. The tapestry is old and frayed. A dagger is concealed behind the tapestry.
16. Daubed on the whitewashed wall in large faded black letters is the single word, “Obey.” Bloody handprints cover the surrounding wall.
17. The floor in this area is awash with dirty water. Four empty buckets lie nearby, as do a pile of dirty cloths. From the sodden, dirt-streaked cloths, it seems the slaves are washed here—perhaps forcibly.
18. Four iron rings large enough to run a chain through have been driven into the wall at about shoulder height for a human male. The inside of each ring is worn smooth, but the outsides are rusty and scratched.
19. Dried blood on the wall and floor show where at least one person was savagely beaten. The stains—smeared and now dry—are large and bear mute testimony to the violence employed by the slavers to keep their charges under control.
20. Straw covers the floor of this small area. Rings sunk into the wall with short chains hanging limply decorate one wall. The smell of faeces and wet dogs fills the air. Graffiti —mainly scratched into the wall with stones hidden within the straw—covers the walls. Mainly the graffiti comprises dates and names. If the characters are searching for a particular slave, this is a good place for them to find a clue. 





## MINOR EVENTS 



1. Guttural laughter precedes the arrival of two bored, drunk guards who have decided to visit the slave pens for some fun. They are distracted, and the characters can easily surprise them (if they are at all stealthy).
2. Screams echo throughout the compound. A slave is being beaten for some transgression (real or imagined). The beating goes on for some time; by the end, the slave is badly injured (and unconscious).
3. An unwholesome mixture of sweat, fear, urine and excrement greet the party's nostrils. The smell becomes stronger the closer the party get to the slave pens.
4. Screams, punctuated by the crack of a whip, shatter the air. The screaming goes on for a few minutes before gradually fading away.
5. A faint sobbing reaches the characters' ears. The sobbing slowly draws closer until an elderly slave shuffles around the corner carrying two full slop buckets. Tears mist his eyes when he realises the characters are not slavers, and he begs to be rescued. He introduces himself as Milano and can give the characters a good idea of the compound's layout.
6. A mixture of faint sobs and guttural laughter reaches the characters' ears. If the characters follow the sounds, they discover a slaver tormenting a sobbing, cowering woman. The slaver has his back to the characters and a whip in his raised hand. If rescued, the woman—Feridia— is grateful and desperate to escape. She sticks closely to any female character in the party.
7. A loud clanging—perhaps an alarm bell—shatters the relative quiet. In response, a general hubbub of shouting comes from some distant area. The ringing goes on for about 30 seconds before fading away.
8. The sound of someone rattling the bars of their cell dimly reaches the party's ears. The rattling goes on for some time until a high-pitch screech ends it. 





## SLAVES WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Varinius (N old male human): Varinius is old and weak. He is a sage of some renown captured during a recent raid. His once fine robes are ripped and travel-stained. Now unable to stand without aid, he is perhaps only a few days from death. If rescued and nursed back to health, he is grateful and offers to serve the characters. He would, of course, require a place to work, but his knowledge is prodigious.
2. Albina (N young female human) Protected by the other slaves, Albina is only nine-years-old. Her brother escaped from the raid that saw her taken, and she doesn't know what happened to him. Sadly, her mother and father both died protecting her, and she is quite alone in the world.
3. Avel (CN male human fighter 1): While he might be a slave, Avel—in his mind—is free. Charismatic and mad as a bag of cats, Avel has decided he is the Emperor of the World and that his fellow slaves are his courtiers and servants. Occasionally, he utters decrees and becomes hysterically angry when his demands are not carried out. He also fears assassination. His fellow slaves ignore him as much as they can—which in this confined space is difficult in the extreme.
4. Harek (NE male human thief 4): Harek is a thief sold into slavery to pay for his crimes. Thus far, he has managed to conceal his crimes from his fellows. If rescued his larcenous nature soon reasserts itself. At first, he contents himself with looting the bodies of any slain slavers he comes across. When this source of loot dries up, he targets the least perceptive rescuer. If confronted, he flees.
5. Ibba (CN male human fighter 2): Once a soldier, Ibba has languished in the slavers' cells for months. A large, powerful man, Ibba possesses a deep streak of individualism, which makes him a terrible slave. Beaten repeatedly, his sullen insolence has led to many failed viewing by potential buyers drawn to his powerful, muscular frame. If freed, he may serve a similarly-minded character for a while, but will eventually wander off.
6. Unila (N male human): Once a fisherman, Unila was captured by pirates and his incarceration here is the last in a long line of indignations. Grey-eyed and balding, Unila is in his mid-thirties and yet strong. His clothes are old and frayed. He just wants to go home but fears what has happened to his wife and children since he was taken over a year ago. If freed and given funds, he is pathetically grateful but quickly leaves.
7. Giso (N female human): This heavily tattooed woman— Giso—has an exotic caste to her mien. However, she is blind—having had her eyes put out at the culmination of a religious ceremony decades ago. Widely believed to be a seeress, she is thought to be valuable by the slavers and, consequently, has enjoyed slightly better conditions than her fellows. Far from home, she has no real friends. Without help, she will likely die on the streets.
8. Unnamed (N male human): This dark-haired, scrawny man lies at the back of the cell and seems all but catatonic. He doesn't react to or answer questions but can be gently led about. He does nothing of his own accord except the most basic of actions—eating, drinking and so on. No one in the cell knows anything about him.
9. Avila (N female human): Somehow, this skinny young woman, Avila, has managed to stay with her toddler. She dotes on the child—Irma—and is fiercely protective. Nothing is more important to her, and she begs for food and assistance from any kindly-looking rescuer. Avila has a mean streak, however, and happily takes her revenge on any helpless slavers falling into her grasp.
10. Ekur (CE male minotaur): Wrapped in chains and covered in bruises, Ekur, a minotaur warrior, thirsts for revenge. He demands the characters allow him to slake his thirst with his captors' blood. Ekur agrees to any reasonable conditions for his freedom. If he subsequently encounters any slavers, his barbarity and savagery in the ensuing combat are breathtaking. Ekur's continuing freedom is, of course, a tricky matter for the characters. Evil, and in many people's eyes a monster, Ekur cannot easily roam the land, but slaying him out of hand might give some characters pause. 





## SLAVERS WITH PERSONALITY 



1. Agis (CE male human fighter 3): Preternaturally tall and rake-thin Agis was abused mercilessly as a child by his peers. This torment twisted his soul, and he now unleashes his childhood frustrations on his charges. A sadist, he is hated by those he guards. Even his fellow slavers give him a wide berth; Agis is unpredictable, and his humour is very much an acquired taste.
2. Harek (NG male human fighter 2): Harek doesn't want to be here and is miserable and terrified. Several years ago, he was faced with a stark choice: live on the street or sign up with the slavers. Since then, he has regretted his choice and desperately wants to leave. Wracked with guilt, he tries to make his charges' lives as easy as possible. He sneaks them extra food and only beats them when he absolutely must. Consequently, he is almost liked by the slaves he watches. If he survives the characters' assault, any freed slaves lobby for his release.
3. Joried (N female human thief 2): A petty thief—and not a good one—Joried views her membership of the slavers as a good opportunity for virtually risk-free, minor thievery. She always tries to be the one to process new arrivals and steals whatever she can find concealed about their persons. She has hidden her spoils in an outof- the-way storeroom and uses them as a bargaining tool to secure her freedom if captured by the characters.
4. Ceol (CE male human fighter 1): Ceol is a coward and terrified the slaves will rise up and slay their masters. Unless he can help it he is never alone with any slaves (unless they are securely restrained). If he encounters the characters, he immediately flees—even abandoning fellow slavers—to “get help”. A weaselly man, Ceol sports a scraggly beard and an abundance of knives—which he thinks makes him look tough.
5. Praen (CE male human fighter 3): With a heavily scarred face and balding Praen fits the cliched image of a ferocious, vicious man. With Praen what you see is what you get. He cares only for himself; others are merely tools. Praen is also unable to back down from an argument and believes shouting is normally a winning tactic. if that fails, he resorts to extreme violence.
6. Inga (CE female human fighter 2): Immensely fat, and with questionable hygiene, Inga is middle-aged and much inured to the suffering around her. To her, the world is a hard place, and you are either hunter or hunted. Dark rumours accusing her of witchcraft and cannibalism circulate among the slaves, but these are untrue. In truth, she is just a deeply unpleasant person.
7. Teuvo (CG male human fighter 1): Teuvo is masquerading as a slaver while he tracks down and frees his aged mother, taken in a slaving raid a year ago. His mother—Irja—is a skilled jeweller, and he believes she has been sold to a buyer in need of her particular skills. He immediately surrenders to the characters, if given a chance, and attempts to recruit them to his cause.
8. Elir Nuralegg (NE male dwarf fighter 4): Elir stinks. Personal hygiene does not trouble Elir, and he takes perverse pleasure in standing as close as possible to his comrades. Elir neither hates nor cares for the slaves under his control. To him, they are short-lived humans worth only what someone will pay for them. With long hair, an impossibly tangled beard and dirty, sweaty studded leather Elir certainly makes an impression.
9. Varma (N female human fighter 2): Varma is a slaver because she is worried that if she isn't, she'll instead be a slave. To prove her worth, she is outwardly even more uncaring and vicious than her fellows. She is, however, wracked by guilt but terrified of trying to leave or helping the slaves. She breaks down in tears and begs for mercy and forgiveness if captured. If she is spared, she turns herself around and founds an orphanage to atone for her sins. If the characters ever come this way again, she remembers them and does her best to assist them in any way she can.
10. Filimer (CE male human fighter 4): Even more vicious, depraved and merciless than the average demon, Filimer was once a slave himself. He bettered his lot by informing on and beating to death troublemakers and malcontents. When he stymied a prison break, he was rewarded with his freedom. Now, he delights in tormenting those who once shared his station. His quarters are a place of nightmare, and he delights in torture. If he falls into the slaves' hands, his fate will be drawn-out and painful in the extreme. 





## LOOTING THE SLAVER' S BODY 



1. Four links of bloodstained chain ending in a single bloody manacle fill this slaver's pouch. (Close examination reveals hairs stuck in the dried blood on the manacle.) A snapped-off key fills the manacle's lock.
2. A long braid of blond hair wrapped around a slender, whittled stick of white wood protected by a scrap of redhued silk fills this pouch. The hair looks clean and recently washed and is the slaver's trophy harvested from a beautiful woman who fell into his clutches.
3. A handful of tarnished and clipped silver and copper coins from a variety of different cultures and kingdoms. All are old.
4. This small silver locket opens to reveal a tiny painting of a severe-looking woman wearing a ball gown. The clasp for the locket's chain is broken—perhaps it was ripped from its owner's neck.
5. This slaver collected jewellery from his victims. His pouch holds three earrings—one bronze pair and a single golden stud—along with a half-dozen rings. All are cheap “costume style” pieces except for the single golden ear stud (worth 5 gp).
6. A battered leather scroll tube contains sketches of several individuals in suggestive poses. Every subject has a profoundly sad or scared look on their face. The sketches, however, were rendered by a skilled artist.
7. Three teeth wrapped in a scrap of bloody cloth. Each has a gold filling (worth in total 1 gp). The teeth are badly cracked and scoured—it looks like someone used pliers to extract them.
8. A ripped yellow silk shirt with a bloody cuff rolled into a tight ball. The shirt is worth 5 gp if cleaned and repaired; otherwise, it is essentially worthless.
9. Three six-sided bone dice with crudely inked pips. One of the dice is loaded and always comes up on the number one. The three dice sit inside a snug, custommade leather pouch with the initials JF burnt into the lid.
10. A small set of rusting iron pliers with worn handles. Dried blood mars the plier's jaws, and its crude spring squeaks loudly if the pliers are used.
11. This coil of seven-foot-long bloody rope has been used as a crude (and heavy) whip. One end of the rope is matted with blood and hair; the other ends in a thick, tight knot.
12. A small pouch with a fold-over top holds a half dozen slender knives. All are razor-sharp and spotlessly clean. Some have very strangely shaped tips. To a collector of torture equipment—or perhaps an apothecary or necromancer—the set is worth 50 gp.
13. A bunch of nondescript keys hanging from a small, overloaded ring. Some of the keys are worn, and several are broken. One, however, unlocks the manacles used by the slavers and is part of a sick, twisted game played by this individual.
14. Two creased, crumpled and sweat-stained black hoods. Neither has a mouth or eye holes. Worryingly, both have drawstrings enabling them to be tightly secured around the wearers' heads.
15. A small black branding iron; a stylised S forms the iron's head. The tips of the S end in crude snake heads. The iron is wrapped in bloody, scorched cloth.
16. A small half-full wineskin containing a powerful, but harsh, brandy smelling strongly of blackberries.
17. A large brass key with worn teeth. A strip of red-coloured string hangs from one end. The key is too large to fit any of the locks in the compound.
18. A dirty, bloodstained strip of cloth wrapped around a two-foot-long wooden cudgel. The cudgel's handle is worn, suggesting it has seen prolonged use.
19. A nondescript brown hemp hood with crudely cut eye and mouth holes. The hood looks like it has been fashioned from a small sack. A splatter of dried blood covers the front.
20. Two-score individually cloth wrapped silver coins fill this small pouch which is secured with rope wrapped around and around it. All are from different nations or kingdoms and have different designs. Each individually wrapped parcel is tied shut with string. 





# SMUGGLERS' LAIR 


## THINGS IN A SMUGGLER' S LAIR 



1. A discarded sack lies against one wall; grain—now rotten —spills from a rip near its base and covers the floor. Footprints are evident in the grain and could give the characters a clue as to who has recently passed this way.
2. A crude map depicting the coastline and showing several little known isolated coves and sea caves covers one wall. Drawn in chalk, the smugglers try to rub it out if they know they are being attacked as it shows the locations of several of their secret caches.
3. This area smells of sweat and faeces. Several sets of manacles are affixed to the wall with iron chains running through loops driven deep into the stone.
4. Several sets of wet, homespun clothes lie draped over several natural folds in the cavern wall. Damp from immersion in the sea, the clothes are encrusted with salt.
5. A pile of fishing nets fill one corner of the cavern. Bits of seaweed cling to the sodden nets and a small puddle of saltwater has gathered below them.
6. A carving of a sailing ship running under full sail before a raging storm covers a cave wall. The carving has obviously taken weeks of skilled work and cleverly uses the rock's natural folds to depict the storm clouds.
7. The tang of salt and the smell of smoke hangs heavily in the air.
8. A half-full barrel of fresh(ish) water stands against one wall. A small bucket—really nothing more than an oversized tankard—perches atop the barrel's lid.
9. Three barrels holding saltwater, but without their lids, line one wall. Two of the barrels hold nothing but water while at the bottom of the third lurk several crabs destined for the smugglers' stew.
10. A rusted harpoon leans against one wall; faint carvings of cresting waves decorate half of the weapon's shaft.
11. Several niches pierce the walls; the entrance to each is obscured by a tarpaulin nailed to the wall with pitons. Investigations reveal the niches serve as cramped, uncomfortable places for the smugglers to rest.
12. A large, haphazard pile of driftwood—destined for the smugglers' fires—fills part of this area. The wood is sodden and difficult to light.
13. A small shrine dedicated to the goddess of the sea and storms fills a small wall niche; half-burnt candles and a few coins serve as votive offerings to placate the goddess and her capricious moods.
14. The smugglers use this hole in the floor as a dump of sorts. The hole is linked to the sea and tidal; thus rubbish does not build up too much. However, fish bones, bits of shredded cloth and other rubbish cover the surrounding floor. A small cat—a smuggler's pet—lurks here playing with a mouldering fish corpse. It hisses at intruders.
15. Here the floor level changes dramatically. The smugglers have built a rickety wood stair out of planks salvaged from a wreck. Although basically sound, the stairs creak if any great weight is placed upon them; this sound could warn any smugglers lurking nearby.
16. An empty wineskin lies discarded on the floor; the faint smell of acidic red wine emanates from the skin.
17. The furniture here—a table, two benches and a highbacked chair—are all expertly crafted from driftwood. Although they have no real value, a gullible eccentric could pay perhaps 20 gp for the set.
18. A ship's lantern hangs from the ceiling at the end of a short chain. The chain is wrapped around a jagged rocky outcrop which causes the lantern to sway gently. Three flasks of lamp oil lie against the wall.
19. Some acoustic fluke fills this section of caves with the sound of crashing surf, making conversation difficult. However, the pounding of the waves against the cliffs also makes it much easier to sneak about quietly.
20. Several strange, almost sinuous rock outcroppings protrude from one wall. From one angle, they look a little bit like tentacles—as if some terrible aquatic beast of the deep had been petrified in some way and melded into the cavern wall. 

## PORTABLE GOODS 



1. A dozen small packets of pepper (each weighs 1 lb. and is worth 2 gp).
2. Four bottles of fine red wine (each worth 5 gp).
3. Four packets of tea (each weighs 1 lb. and is worth 5 gp).
4. A bag of ermine fur (weighs 5 lbs., worth 25 gp).
5. The glossy pelt from a gigantic white wolf (weighs 10 lbs., worth 20 gp).
6. A small wooden box full of grey powder mixed with small bone fragments (weighs. 10 lbs., worth—to a necromancer—50 gp).
7. A small pouch of diamond dust (weighs 1.2 lb., worth 250 gp).
8. A bundle of exquisite lace (weighs 3 lb., worth 15 gp).
9. Three bolts of silk (red, yellow and blue; each weighs 1/2 lb. and is worth 4 gp.
10. A thick roll of red velvet (weighs 6 lb., worth 16 gp) stuffed in a sack.
11. A small wooden box packed out with straw within which is carefully placed 10 perfume vials (weighs 10 lbs., worth 30 gp).
12. Six packets of coffee (weighs 12 lb., worth 90 gp). 





## LOOTING A SMUGGLER' S BODY 



1. This small, dented steel hip flask is full of cheap brandy. A terrible engraving of a sailing ship decorates the flask.
2. This pouch contains a black scarf large enough to be wrapped around the lower part of its owner's head. It smells of salt and sweat.
3. These fine, much-worn, but well maintained, thigh-high leather boots conceal a thin dagger in a specially made sheath sewn into the left boot.
4. This voluminous scarlet cloak has a similarly allconcealing hood. Several hidden pouches sewn into the cloak's lining are large enough to contain a full coin pouch or several pieces of jewellery and the like.
5. A small bag holds several clumps of dried seaweed cut into small strips. The pouch smells strongly of salt and the sea.
6. This smuggler wears a golden earring crafted to resemble a leaping dolphin, in his left ear. The earring is tarnished and worn, and the tiny gems that once filled its eye sockets have long since fallen out and been lost.
7. Clad in faded and ripped clothes, this smuggler had clearly fallen on hard times. Observant characters searching the body discover a worn gold ring on one of the man's toes. The ring is worth 10 gp.
8. A necklace of long, sharp teeth—perhaps from a small shark or another marine predator—hangs around this smuggler's neck. The teeth, hanging from a thin leather thong, clack together when the wearer moves (which reduces their chance of moving silently).
9. This wide leather belt has a secret compartment big enough to hold five coins. Only observant characters examining the belt find the (empty) compartment.
10. This smuggler owned an old map of the surrounding coastline. The map is old, faded and torn in two. It is, however, carefully rolled up around a short length of smooth, polished wood and stored in a small leather belt pouch.
11. A pouch at this smuggler's waist holds a lump of driftwood, partly whittled into a whale's likeness.
12. A small pouch holds strips of dried fish wrapped in a thin cloth. The fish is chewy and tastes of salt and smoke.
13. This smuggler wore a jaunty, wide-brimmed hat decorated with a thin crimson sash.
14. A stone figurine of the capricious sea goddess is draped with seaweed and jammed into a pouch barely big enough to take the statuette.
15. This ragged yellow velvet cloak is ripped at the hem and bears several obvious, but unidentifiable, stains. In its current state, the cloak looks worthless. However, if cleaned and cannibalised to make a short cape, the garment could be sold for 2 gp.
16. Carvings of crashing waves decorate this small wooden box holding several small keepsakes: a lock of blond hair, a small painting of a plain-looking woman with similar coloured hair and several wisps of silken fabric.
17. A small flask of linseed wood, a grimy cloth and several small knives all stored in the smuggler's backpack identifies him as a woodcarver.
18. A strip of woollen blanket is wrapped around the battered remains of a spyglass, which is missing most of its lease; only glass shards remain.
19. A thick pair of sealskin gloves is wrapped around this smuggler's broad leather belt. The gloves are in excellent condition.
20. This smuggler wore a cleverly crafted pouch wrapped around his left ankle. Lying almost flush to the skin, only a careful search reveals its presence. Inside, the smuggler hid four small black stones (onyx, each worth 20 gp). 

## THINGS IN A CARGO HOLD 



1. A common lamp hangs from the hold's ceiling. The lamp is clearly faulty—oil drips from its base and pools on the floor. Not only could someone slip and fall here, but an open flame might also prove disastrous.
2. Boxes and barrels fill the hold from floor to ceiling. One particular pile seems precariously balanced...
3. The carcass of a dead rat lies on the floor; its back is broken. Of what killed the rat, there is no sign.
4. A sailor lies behind several crates clearly placed to shield a small, shadowy recess. He is dead drunk; a flask lies near his outstretched hand.
5. The chattering and scuttling of many rats comes to the characters' ears. From the volume, it seems the hold is literally infested with the things.
6. The lid of a long, low box set carefully against the far wall is loose. The box smells of damp earth. Within, earth fills the box. Characters searching through the soil find it riddled with plant seeds. The seeds are from a rare and expensive species of rose; the whole is bulky—it weights 400 lbs.—but worth 125 gp. (Of course, paranoid characters may suspect a vampire lairs within.) 





## MINOR SMUGGLED TREASURES 



1. Two small wooden kegs of fine brandy stamped with the seal of a famed distiller. Each keg weighs 20 lbs. and is worth 50 gp.
2. The lid of this small coffer is sealed with white wax. The coffer feels light if picked up as if it were empty. In reality, it contains ten sealed packets of exotic spices each sealed with wax and stamped with a seal depicting a stylised sailboat. The whole is worth 150 gp.
3. One bolt of blue silk and one bolt of red silk wrapped tightly in an oversized sack. Each bolt contains enough material for five cloaks and is worth 75 gp.
4. A lidless chest holds six large clay jars packed with straw. Each of the jars holds peaches steeped in whisky. A current favourite among the local nobility, each jar is worth 20 gp.
5. This large chest contains a mass of junk silver and gold including damaged coins, broken jewellery and blobs of already melted down precious metal. Destined for a jeweller of dubious moral character, the chest weighs 150 lbs. The contents are worth 250 gp.
6. An exquisitely made silk and lace ball gown wrapped in a wide and soft roll of cotton.
7. This small finely crafted coffer contains an exquisite glass decanter along with four matching glasses. Nestled in a cushion of blue velvet the set is with 80 gp.
8. This large barrel of middling to fair quality red wine contains a secret. Hidden within—in a waterproof sack— are three scrolls of animate dead. The wine itself is worth 10 gp to a tavern or similar establishment. 9. Wet sand fills this heavy barrel, covered in thick blankets. Buried within the sand are two large eggs the size of a human head. They are warm to the touch; what they contain is anyone's guess.
10. This rough wooden box is roughly four-foot-long and holds the crumbling bones of a halfling or gnome. In life, the deceased was a prominent citizen of a nearby town who was rumoured to know certain secrets of the local nobility. A necromancer desires these secrets and so has secured the individual's bones so he can use them to speak with dead.
11. A wooden case contains six bottles of exquisite elven wine; each is worth 20 gp—even the bottles are delicate works of art.
12. This stiff and dry sheepskin glimmers in the light; silver flecks impregnate the heavy fleece. It is worth 20 gp.
13. A large cask of cracked salt worth 15 gp.
14. A silk shirt wrapped voluminously in faded red cloth. The shirt is impregnated with bubonic plague and will play centre stage in an upcoming assassination.
15. A pile of fur pelts stuffed into several sacks. Among the more common wolf, fox and rabbit pelts are a full owlbear pelt (complete with clawed hands and beaked head) and a thick, gorgeous winter wolf pelt. Each of these atypical pelts is worth 100 gp, while the others are worth a total of 25 gp.
16. A robust chest contains several trade bars of precious metals of the type used by mints or jewellers. There are five silver bars (each worth 5 gp), four gold bars (each worth 50 gp) and a platinum bar (worth 500 gp). Each of the bars bears the crest of a nearby kingdom.
17. Six small flasks hold a rare red dye much in demand due to recent fashion changes. Each flask is worth 5 gp.
18. A small dark wood coffer contains 12 small packets of exotic incense. The coffer is worth 20 gp, and each packet is worth 15 gp.
19. Six tightly sealed earthen jars hold preserved exotic fruits. Two jars contain pineapples (worth 7 gp each) and three contain pomegranate segments (worth 7 gp each). The last jar is cracked and holds rotting coconut.
20. A large cage contains a beaten and starved baby griffon destined to be the plaything of a noble obsessed with owning the most exotic mounts. Although caged and maltreated, the griffon is still a proud, violent predator. Characters getting too close to the cage could be in for a shock. 





##  EVENTS IN A ROWBOAT 



1. A seagull flies overhead and splatters one of the boat's occupants with excrement.
2. A largish wave hits the boat, and the characters on that side of the boat get soaked.
3. The boat bumps into a floating spar.
4. A sudden swell threatens to pull an oar from a rower's hands. If dropped, the oar floats nearby but tantalisingly out of reach.
5. A seabird alights on the boat's bow and caws loudly at the occupants.
6. Something large bumps against the bottom of the boat.
7. A school of fish swims about the boat for a while before suddenly dispersing.
8. A large seagull swoops down and tries to grab some food from the hand of one of the boat's occupants.
9. The rowboat has a small leak and begins to slowly fill with water. Ten minutes bailing every hour is sufficient to keep ahead of the leak.
10. A larger swell rocks the boat. Anyone standing up must make brace themselves or fall into the water.
11. The black shadow of some large aquatic beast glides below the boat.
12. A sudden squall passes over the rowboat, soaking everyone within. The rain only lasts 2d10 minutes.
13. One of the rowboat's oars cracks, and 1d6 minutes later it snaps. Unless the characters have a spare or use magic to fix the broken oar, their movement rate is halved.
14. While rowing, one of the characters snags a shredding fishing net. Clearly, something large and powerful destroyed it.
15. The rowboat passes through a small patch of floating debris. Sadly, there is nothing of value to recover from among the splinters of wood, waterlogged (empty) sack and scraps of sail.
16. The boat attracts the attention of a small flock of seagulls. They swoop and soar in the air above the boat. Throwing food into the water distracts them.
17. One of the boat's occupants thinks he saw a swimmer about 50 ft. away. A wave obscures him momentarily from view, and no one else spots anything of note. The swimmer does not reappear.
18. Angry, black rain clouds darken the horizon. After a few minutes, it is obvious they are moving toward the characters' boat.
19. A fierce wind picks up, and the waves grow bigger. Controlling the boat becomes difficult, and the spray drenches everyone.
20. Something thuds against the rowboat's hull below the waterline, and the boat spring a leak. Unless rapid repairs are made, the boat sinks after about 30 minutes. Energetic bailing can extend this time. A strong character bailing extends the boat's "life" by 10 minutes if he bails for 10 minutes. After every hour of bailing, a character must rest or become fatigued. As many characters as are in the boat can bail, assuming they have something to scoop out the water. 

## THINGS IN A ROWBOAT 



1. Three black hooded cloaks are stuffed under one of the rowboat's benches. They are all slightly wet and smell of salt and sweat.
2. A thick sack shoved into the rowboat's stern holds a small leather bag filled with hardtack, three water flasks and a small half-full flask of brandy.
3. Two shards of a broken oar lie at the bottom of the boat.
4. A wooden bucket with a rope handle lies on its side at the bottom of the boat. Nearby lies a couple of simple fishing rods and a pouch containing a half-dozen colourful lures.
5. A large piece of canvas is draped over the boat's stern to create a sheltered, but cramped, cabin of sorts. Within, lies a single damp bedroll along with a change of plain but sturdy peasant's clothes.
6. A small cupboard at the stern holds a battered lantern, three flasks of oil and a tinderbox wrapped in oilskin. A mildewed blanket fills the bottom shelf.
7. A 20 ft. length of damp rope is coiled around one of the rowboat's benches. The rope smells of tar.
8. This rowboat must have a small leak somewhere. An inch or so of seawater fills the bottom of the boat and a wooden bucket—perhaps used for bailing—lies nearby.
9. Four empty wine flasks lie scattered about the boat. A fifth flask yet holds the dregs of some truly terrible wine.
10. A fishing net lies neatly piled at one end of the boat and is tied to the bow with a long length of line. Next to the net stands a cut-down barrel half-filled with seawater.
11. This rowboat has a short mast that can be raised or lowered. A large emblem of a soaring seagull decorates the sail's yellowing canvas.
12. A dozen or so heavy planks fill the bottom of this rowboat, making it ride low in the water. 





## THINGS ON A BEACH 



1. Thick clumps of seaweed cover a tangle of driftwood deposited at the high tide mark.
2. The broken body of a large crab the size of a rat bobs in the shallows. Its shell has been ripped off.
3. The rotten corpse of a dolphin bobs in the water just offshore. Several seagulls perch on the corpse and tear at its flesh.
4. A battered and broken figurehead lies just above the high tide line. The burnt—now rotten wood—depicts a mailed female warrior. Part of her outstretched right arm is missing.
5. A leather flask floats in a rock pool. The flask has been sealed with wax, and inside inquisitive characters discover the map for a small island depicting a raised headland, a stylised hut and a wrecked ship. The island has a distinctive shape, and a skilled sailor or knowledgeable local knows its name and rough location. Alternatively, a sage or other learned individual versed in geography can identify the island for a small fee.
6. A broken oar, missing half its paddle is wedged into a crack between two large rocks. Something possessing considerable strength obviously shattered the oar.
7. One leg bone from a human-sized creature lies tangled up among a mass of seaweed and driftwood.
8. A seagull carcass—one wing missing—lies broken in a cleft between two rocks. Insects swarm over the corpse.
9. The remains of a wooden crate float in the water a score of feet offshore. If any character retrieves it, they discover the crate is empty. Perceptive characters spot partial tooth marks in the wood below the waterline. Judging by the bite marks whatever attacked the crate was obviously quite large.
10. Someone has dug a deep hole—perhaps as deep as a man is tall—in the beach above the high tide line. Water has seeped into the hole, obscuring the bottom.
11. Several holes have been dug in the beach seemingly at random spots. A spade—its handle snapped in half—lies discarded at the bottom of one hole.
12. A rowboat's prow sticks out of the sand halfway down the beach. Digging for 20 minutes in the wet sand reveals the rest of the boat. A small sack holding spoiled food, and a still good flask of brandy is wedged under one of the boat's partially collapsed seats.
13. Pieces of flotsam and jetsam fill the beach's rock pools.
14. A swarm of crabs crawl amongst a swath of seaweed covering much of the beach.
15. A barrel bobs in the water just offshore. It holds a couple of pints of wine.
16. The rotting corpse of a long snake-like creature lies sprawled at the high tide mark. A rotten stench hangs about the corpse; scavengers have dined extensively upon its flesh.
17. A rowboat has been pulled far up on the beach. It contains a set of oars and a backpack holding a day's rations, a flask of vinegarish wine and some fishing equipment. Of the owner, there is no sign.
18. A rudimentary cairn overlooks the beach. Moss grows over the stones and a smattering of wildflowers cover the surrounding area.
19. Several large boulders dominate one part of the beach. On the largest—which is fully 20 ft. high—someone has built a small bonfire. It is not yet lit.
20. A body bobs in the surf. Investigations reveal it to be of a human male who has been in the water for some time. Although the body is decomposing and has been worried by scavengers, a large knife wound is evident in his back. 

## FLOTSAM & JETSAM 



1. The shattered, sodden remain of a wooden crate. One side of the crate is smashed and splintered. A merchant's sigil—a balanced set of scales—is visible in the wood.
2. A splintered deck plank has been worn smooth by the tread of many feet.
3. A ripped piece of brown hemp sackcloth. The sack is tied with a gaudy red string, but its bottom has been ripped out.
4. A large branch stripped of all lesser growths and leaves. It shows signs of being gnawed at one end.
5. The rotten, half-eaten carcass of a large fish. Its head yet remains vaguely intact.
6. A small wooden cask. The cask is watertight. If the lid is pried off, the characters discover a mass of straw. Packed within the straw are a dozen packets of exotic spices (worth 75 gp in total).
7. The ripped shreds of a fishing net; the decomposing body of a large fish caught in the net either anchors it to the beach or keeps it just below the water's surface.
8. A small, beautifully carved wooden fish. The sigil of the sea goddess is carved into the fish's back.
9. A ragged pair of bright green trousers. The seat of the trousers is missing—all that remains is a jagged hole clearly made by something large…with teeth.
10. A large chunk of black porous, buoyant rock. The rock could have been floating in the sea for decades—it slowly made its way here from some distant volcanic island—or it could be the result of a wizard's bizarre experiment. 





## THINGS IN A SEA CAVE 



1. A thick line of seaweed—rife with hundreds of tiny crabs— marks the high tide mark. The tangy smell of salt hangs thickly in the air.
2. Flotsam and jetsam bobs in the water, bumping against the slick cave walls.
3. Deep rock pools dot the cave's foreshore. Surprisingly large crabs lurk within.
4. The cold remains of a campfire stand sentinel on a stony, promontory near the cave's mouth.
5. A battered rowboat—its mooring line floating nearby— bobs in the water near the cave mouth. Of its occupants, there is no sign, but congealed blood covers the only oar still in the boat.
6. A ledge high up on one wall holds a multitude of burnt, melted candles. The rock above is blackened with soot.
7. A precarious tower of single stones piled one on top of another stands upon a prominent rock overlooking the water. The slightest touch causes it to collapse.
8. A small cairn toward the back of the caverns holds the body of a fallen adventurer. Explorers digging through the cairn discover scraps of bone and rotting or rusted (unusable) equipment.
9. Oval, black barnacles grow in profusion below the waterline of the cave. Most seem normal, but a few have odd purple flecks upon their surface.
10. The cave is bereft of seaweed, except for one corner where someone or something has created a great mound of the stuff. Within, swarms of tiny crabs lair.
11. A small passageway leads away from the cave mouth. Perceptive characters notice signs the ceiling has been at least p a r t i a l l y w o r k e d . T h e passageway comes to an abrupt halt after about 30 ft.
12. Bizarrely, the shattered curve of part of a stone archway is visible in the water at low tide.
13. Small fish swarm in the water. The fishing here is particularly easy.
14. The cave's mouth is wide but low. Within, the cavern roof is much higher, but its low mouth makes entering the cave several hours on either side of high tide impossible without a short underwater swim.
15. At the rear of the cave, a small stream of fresh water trickles out of a narrow fissure in the rock.
16. A rockfall fills one corner of the cave. It looks unstable, even to the untrained eye. The next storm will carry away several boulders at its base, causing the rest to collapse. Beyond, lies an unexplored passageway.
17. Remnants of carven stone steps rise out of the water. Several of the lower steps have been all but worn away by the remorseless tides, and slick green slime covers much of the remaining stonework.
18. Incongruously, a large sodden branch still bedecked with many leaves bobs in the water.
19. This cave is, or was, something of a lover's grotto. Graffiti scratched into the walls proclaims many couples' undying love for one another.
20. The rock around this sea cave's mouth is covered by lush vegetation that hangs down and obscures the entrance. Within, a pile of large stones serves as a small altar. Crude holy symbols daub the walls ,and various esoteric sigils (drawn with various different coloured chalk) complete the decorations. The air here is cold 






# SMUGGLERS' VILLAGE 


## ON THE STREETS 




### DAYTIME 



1. A fisherwoman walks through the village, a large basket of fish on her hip. Two small children—arguing between themselves—follow in the woman's wake.
2. A mangy dog, its tongue hanging out, patrols the village looking for easy-to-steal food. It follows the party and happily takes food or petting from their hands.
3. The sound of waves breaking against the breakwater or beach and the caw of the gulls swooping overhead—the backdrop of daily life—roll through the village.
4. A faint sea mist hangs over the village, deadening sounds and giving the place a slightly ethereal look. The mist is not dense enough to overly affect visibility.
5. The street is busy. The tide is in and the fishing boats have just returned with their daily catch. Consequently, many of the populace are converging on the docks to help unload and process the catch.
6. A small mob of screaming, shouting children rush down the street. They are all armed with sticks—their swords— with which they enthusiastically whack at each other. If asked, they explain they are playing sailors against excise men.
7. Heavy rain lashes the village, and the villagers hurry about their tasks. Few, if any, boats put to sea this day. Consequently, the village tavern fills up early in the afternoon, and the innkeeper benefits from a welcome boost in trade.
8. A wagon filled with (empty) chests rolls into the village. A single well-dressed man (a merchant) aided by a young boy drives the wagon while two bored-looking mercenary guards follow behind on stout riding horses. The small procession makes for the local inn.
9. A mounted mail-clad warrior followed by six mudsplattered men-at-arms enters the village. This is the local lord's exciseman and his escort come to collect taxes. His unwelcome arrival is not an auspicious one for the village.
10. Shouted calls for help from the docks precipitate a general rush to the harbour by all the villagers in earshot. Characters following along discover a fishing crew hauling an injured crew-mate onto the docks. Garbled accounts shouted by the fishermen tell of a shark attack. The injured man is badly injured and bleeding profusely from a mangled arm. 

### NIGHTTIME 



1. A wagon slowly rolls through the village's dark streets. The hooves of the horse pulling the wagon are wrapped in cloth and leather to deaden sound. A hunched and cloaked figure sits atop the wagon.
2. Two cloaked figures flit through the streets. They avoid the flickering pools of light emerging from house windows and keep to the shadows. Both figures carry bulging sacks.
3. Somewhere in the village, a dog begins barking. Characters following the barking may discover nefarious goings-on—perhaps smugglers moving their goods through the village under cover of darkness.
4. Two figures flit through the streets. The two stay close together as if they are linked arm to arm. Suspicious characters investigating reveal the two are lovers—and are on their way to a special place they have to spend some alone time together. (Or, at least, that's what they tell the characters.)
5. An owl hoots loudly from the middle of the village. This could indeed be a hunting owl or it could be a smuggler's signal.
6. A flash of light on the street shows where a traveller briefly unmasked a lantern. The light is swiftly hidden. By the time the characters reach the spot, the lantern's owner has disappeared into the darkness.
7. Rain falls and turns the streets into mud. Consequently, tracking is easier than normal (if done before the rain effaces any tracks left in the mud). Few venture abroad in the rain.
8. Shouts and curses herald the start of a street brawl between two rival groups of fishermen (or perhaps smugglers). The groups could be arguing over fishing rights, recent suspicious damage to one group's boat or even access to a lucrative (and illicit) contact. Unless anyone intervenes—and no villagers do—the brawl continues until one crew retreats into the night.
9. As #1 above but the wagon is piled high with boxes and barrels—salted meats, imported wines and spirits and the like—and is escorted by four burly, alert smugglers. The wines and spirits are destined for the village inn while the food will be sold to a nameless man buying up enough provisions to feed a substantial expedition (as he puts it). The man is a guest at the village inn and is travelling under an assumed name. He is clearly wealthy and is accompanied by six no-nonsense, mail-clad vigilant bodyguards.
10. Characters out after dark looking towards the sea spot the shadow of a large ship under full sail making for the harbour. Perceptive characters notice several smaller shadows—perhaps some of the village's fishing boats— making their way out toward the larger vessel. 





## IN THE TAVERN 




### DAYTIME 



1. A solitary server slowly brushes the floor, while a few older patrons sit alone at their tables nursing ales. The taproom is quiet but elsewhere in the tavern someone is humming as they go about their business.
2. A lone woman—Dorotea Rautia (N female human)—sits at the bar nursing a small ale and muttering under her breath. Her boat was recently damaged by a rival, and she lacks the coin to effect proper repairs. She is angry, plotting revenge and on the lookout for easy money.
3. The innkeeper is swapping out several barrels of ale that ran dry last night. The resultant bangs, thumps and crashes are audible from outside the tavern.
4. A young boy sweeps the common room's floor, and he's not putting in a lot of effort. (If his attitude does not improve, the innkeeper notices his indolence and rewards him with a clip around the ear).
5. The innkeeper is behind the bar counting last night's take. He seems in a rare good mood—clearly business (either legal or illegal) is booming.
6. A travelling merchant, Esteri Airikka (LN female human) has arrived at the bar with barrels of fine wine and beer to sell; her prices are not good enough for the landlord, and she is sent packing. Esteri complains to everyone who'll listen that her prices are fair, but the landlord is unreasonable. 

### NIGHTTIME 



1. The taproom is busy; the village's fishermen recently landed several “large catches” and the drinkers are in a rare good mood. Drink flows freely; laughter and singing fill the air.
2. Two rival smuggler crews are in the bar. The two crews recently competed over a cargo, and tensions run high. The two groups sit close to one another, and both are drinking heavily. A brawl is almost certain to ensue.
3. Several crusty old seamen sit around a table loudly singing sea shanties. As the evening wears on, the singing gets louder and more incomprehensible. (Perhaps the shanties contain interesting pieces of local lore dealing with lost treasures, legendary monsters and the like.)
4. A heavily cloaked figure—probably a tall man by his size— enters the bar. The stranger's deep cowl obscures his face. Many of the regulars size up the man as he enters and then completely ignore him as he seats himself at an empty table.
5. A wandering bard is playing sea shanties in the taproom. He's not very good, and most of the customers are ignoring him.
6. Rain hammers down on the village, dampening the spirits of all in the common room. Small groups sit clustered around tables muttering about the weather and its ruinous effect on their “business”. 

## WHISPERS & RUMOURS IN THE TAPROOM 



1. Old Aake Hopea caught something he didn't expect in his net a few days ago—a pirate's bloated corpse. Aake refuses to say anything about his catch but has locked himself in his house ever since.
2. Strangers have been seen around the village in the last few weeks. Many people think the strangers are disguised customs and excise men here to spy on the villagers' doings.
3. The Amma is late. (The Amma is Ambro Kontio's ship; Ambro is a renowned deepwater smuggler and sometime pirate). Some say one of Ambro's old enemies has finally caught up with him while others suggest he may have found the missing piece of the lost treasure map of the legendary pirate captain and bard extraordinaire Vilimzair Aralivar.
4. Aatu's leg is aching; a storm is on the way.
5. Lastikka saw the humped back of a gigantic sea snake yesterday. She was fishing further offshore than normal, and the thing surfaced not a score of yards from her fishing boat!
6. Terrible things lurk beneath the waters of Skull Cove. (Skull Cove lies ten miles along the coast and is named for the shattered skulls periodically found there; locals will not sail into the cove and there is no path down to the cove from the surrounding cliffs).
7. A group of naked sea elves were seen frolicking off the coast last month. With bewitching song, they tried to entice the crew of a nearby fishing vessel into the water. The crew only resisted by stuffing their ears with cheese!
8. The local lord is thinking of building a lighthouse near the village; that will ruin the smugglers' illicit business as no doubt the lighthouse will be heavily garrisoned. 





## AT THE HARBOUR 




### DAYTIME 



1. The harbour is busy; several fishing boat crews are preparing to put to sea for the day. Fisherfolk songs fill the air as gulls wheel and dive overhead.
2. An empty cart trundles down the dock towards a fishing boat moored slightly away from the others. Several crew lounge around the vessel, but a perceptive character realises the sailors are far more alert than they seem.
3. Three fishermen sit on the dock mending their nets. The three chat amongst themselves as they work but fall abruptly silent if the characters approach them.
4. One fishing boat is upside down and out of the water, having some minor repairs done to its hull.
5. Two of the local lord's soldiers saunter around the harbour. They stop to talk with the fisherfolk working on the docks. Perceptive characters might spot some of the sailors slipping a couple of coins into the soldiers' hands.
6. A wagon trundles away from the dock. Open boxes filled with fish lie in its bed; seagulls hover overhead waiting for a chance to swoop down and steal a fish or two. Two children stand among the boxes, short clubs at the ready to fend off any birds swooping at the wagon.
7. A seal swims effortlessly near the harbour as it plays in the surf. Several fishermen wade out toward it with spears in hand, but the canny creature disappears under the waves and does not return. The fishermen emerge from the surf cold, wet and muttering curses of revenge against the elusive creature.
8. Several children take turns jumping from the harbour wall into the water. Their joyful screams and shouts ring out over the hubbub of work.
9. An old, drunk fisherman sits atop a pile of nets muttering to himself. The man has not gone to sea in a year or more and is a renowned local drunk. However, he is perceptive and sees much that goes on around the docks. Characters plying him with drink may learn several interesting titbits of information.
10. A large merchant ship—The Mermaid's Mistress by the name on its bow—slowly edges into the outer harbour and drops anchor. Shortly thereafter, the ship's mistress is rowed to the dock by several of her crew. By the time she reaches dry land, a delegation of several local merchants and traders have gathered to meet her. 

### NIGHTTIME 



1. A lone sailor staggers down the dock singing softly to himself. He slowly disappears into the shadows as his singing fades. Perceptive characters later notice the man lurking in the shadows and intently watching the party.
2. Two men clamber into a rowboat and quietly make to sea. A hooded lantern in the boat's stern is their only light, as they slowly—and quietly—make for open water.
3. A muffled cry followed by a loud splash suggests to sharp-eared characters foul deeds are afoot. When the characters reach the spot where the cry came from, there is no sign of anyone although a dropped bloodied knife lies on the dock and large ripples are spreading outwards from a point in the water nearby.
4. A wagon stands hard against the docks. Beyond, several dark figures transfer boxes and sacks from a nearby fishing vessel to the wagon. Another figure hides in the shadows nearby and keeps an eye out for custom agents, the watch or anyone else who might interfere with the smugglers' business.
5. As the characters approach the docks, a small, grubby child suddenly rushes from the shadows. It looks like the child has been crying and as he approaches the party, he lets out a loud wail. The child could be genuinely upset by something or he could be acting as a watchman for a nearby band of smugglers—that likely includes his father and elder siblings who won't take kindly to anyone hurting or scaring him.
6. The muffled splash of oars reaches perceptive characters' ears. The sounds seem to be coming from just beyond the harbour wall…and are getting closer.
7. The body of a rough and ready sailor-type lies face down on the dock. The man has suffered a serious stab wound to the side and is unconscious. He could be a smuggler knifed by a rival crew or he might be an innocent fisherman who saw something he should not have seen.
8. Perceptive characters notice a dark shape bobbing in the water a score of feet from the nearest boat. This could be a piece of flotsam or jetsam, a playful seal, driftwood or even the body of a smuggler slain during an altercation between rival crews.
9. Two men sit in their fishing boat passing a jack of wine back and forth. The two mutter quietly to themselves as they slowly drink themselves into a stupor. The two could be (bad) lookouts for a smuggling gang or just two fisherfolk relaxing after a hard day out on the water.
10. Several wagons stand on the dock. A dozen or so shadowy figures swarm about the dock transferring boxes, barrels and bundles from fishing boats moored close to the wagons. Another two smugglers—alert for trouble—stand at the end of the dock keeping an eye out for strangers or customs and excise men. 





## FOLK 



1. KUSTAAVA MONTAJA CN female human cleric 2 (Serat) Clad in grey-green robes and sporting a great mop of dishevelled brown hair this burly woman uses a trident as a walking stick. Kustaava worships the Storm Mistress—Serat (CN greater goddess of the sea, storms and voyages)—and has come to the village to watch over the fishermen and their families. Mannerisms: Accustomed to shouting over the roar of the wind, rain and sea Kustaava is a loud conversationalist; whispering is an alien concept, for her. Distinguishing Features: Kustaava's long brown hair is perpetually unkempt. Personality: As wild and unpredictable as the sea, Kustaava can be a handful. She loves drinking and sailing (often at the same time) and is a regular at the village tavern. Hook: Always in search of money to spend on her church, Kustaava approaches the party for a donation, and offers to bless their boat before their next aquatic adventure.
2. AATU KOSTIA N old male human Whip-thin and grizzled this old man wears old seafaring clothes and hobbles about with a pronounced limp. Aatu broke his leg several years ago and this injury coupled with old age has forced him to give up the job he loved. Now, he mends nets and darns sails for a living—and is not very happy about it! Mannerisms: Batu vigorously rubs his injured leg, when thinking or stressed. Distinguishing Features: Aatu walks with a pronounced limp. He is perpetually unshaven. Personality: Cantankerous, mean-spirited and an occasional drunk Attu has few redeeming qualities. Hook: Aatu badly broke his leg several years ago; now, when heavy rain or a storm is imminent it aches terribly, and he must drink to dull the pain. Most villagers take the sight of Aatu drunkenly slumped by the harbour to mean a storm is on the way.
3. IISAK ASIKKA NE middle-aged male human fighter 3 With a thick, greying beard and calloused, horribly scarred hands this burly man cuts an imposing figure. Iisak loves the sea and hates strangers in equal measure. However, he loves gold and if offered enough will take adventurers literally anywhere—even places other fishermen dare not sail. Mannerisms: Iisak has a hard, unblinking stare. Distinguishing Features: Iisak sports a thick, greying beard and has horribly scarred hands. Personality: Iisak does not take kindly to folk poking their noses into his business. Violent and coarse, he has few friends—even his wife doesn't like him. Hook: Fearless and an excellent sailor, if the characters are in need of a fisherman to take them somewhere, they soon learn Iisak is the man for the job—if they can stomach spending time with him.
4. TAHLYS AZARIAN LE female sahuagin With pale white skin, long black hair and black, almost luminous, eyes this beautiful and tall elven woman possesses an otherworldly, ethereal appearance. Tahlys masquerades as an aquatic elf visiting the village with the apparent goal of establishing an alliance. However, she is actually one of the few sahuagin who look like aquatic elves and is here to spy in preparation for a sahuagin raid. Mannerisms: Tahlys speaks only when she must, and her eyes are always darting about. Distinguishing Features: Tahlys's pale skin and black hair mark her out in a crowd. Personality: Evil to the core and wholly without mercy, Tahlys can't wait to summon her fellows to devastate the village and carry off its folk into (brief) slavery. Hook: Perceptive characters notice Tahlys is reserved and offers little information about herself or her fellow elves. She can be encountered almost anywhere in the village— apparently inspecting it because it is so different to her home; she is actually noting its defences. She takes a particular interest in the characters—she knows adventurers can be formidable foes and tries to learn when they'll be moving on. 





## ILLICIT CARGO 



1. Fine white silk fills this ornate coffer of stained oak. Ornate iron hasps wrought in the shape of questing tentacles affix the coffer's lid. The coffer is locked, and the smuggler chief has the only key. Enough silk fills the coffer to make two ballgowns (or similar).
2. Dwarven whiskey fills these four casks. The casks are lashed together in pairs by stout, tar-stained rope. Each cask bears the sigil of a far-off dwarven hold. The whiskey is unbelievably strong both in flavour and alcoholic content.
3. This plain wooden box is nailed shut. The box contains a jumble of bones, ash and soil. Investigation reveals the remains probably belong to one human-sized individual. Signs of violence mar several of the bones.
4. Four small bars of a silvery metal—mithral—fill the false bottom of a stout chest seemingly containing nothing but fine—but mundane—cloth. Only perceptive characters (or those suspicious of the smugglers moving such inexpensive cargo) find the secret compartment.
5. A small but stout wooden crate holds six close-packed silver trade bars stamped with the crest of a nearby kingdom. The crate's lid is nailed shut.
6. Of deep and soft pure white fur, this large and beautiful rug hails from the far north and comprises the hide of a giant polar bear.
7. Light and airy fine elven wine fill four small stout kegs all branded with the symbol of a legendary elven winemaker. Each keg is wrapped in layers of thick cloth to protect it and its contents from damage.
8. This large straw-filled wooden crate holds a score of delicate glass beakers, vials and other pieces of equipment destined for an alchemist conducting forbidden experiments into the very essence of life.
9. Two exquisite cut crystal wine decanters along with a score of delicate wine glasses nestle in this long and thin travel chest. The decanters and glasses nestle in specially made niches lined with black velvet.
10. A hooded war eagle—bred by the centaurs of the Bleak Moor—perches quietly among the other cargo. Small bells attached to the bird's hood softly jingle, when the bird moves.
11. This three-foot-square block of white marble shot through with black and red veins is destined for the workshop of a master sculptor. The stone has magical properties and is one of the raw materials required for the creation of a quasi-sentient magical guardian.
12. Strange, alien glyphs decorate these two delicate porcelain vases and matching bowl. Rusty brown stains mar the inside of all three. The three items are relics of a banned religion that once practised human sacrifice, and are destined for the altar of a nascent evil cult. 





# SNOW & ICE 



## CAMPING & CAMPSITES 



1. A narrow cleft in the rock enables access to a cave buried deep in a craggy hill. Wind-blown snow covers the ground in the entranceway, but the rest of the cave is dry. In the cave, the air temperature is much warmer than outside. The cave can accommodate eight travellers.
2. A stand of trees, their boughs laden with snow, provide a sheltered campsite. Much deadfall lies about the ground, making gathering fuel for a fire easy. A hibernating bear slumbers in a small den in the middle of the wood.
3. The grey ruin of a crumbling building stands stark amid the heaped snow. The building's thatched roof is long gone, but its jagged stone walls remain.
4. A steep-sided valley provides shelter from the wind. A dusting of snow covers the ground and hides an icedover stream. Unwary travellers could fall through the ice into the stream's deep, chill waters.
5. Three part-buried tents stand on the windward side of a low hill. Swamped by snow, the tents are almost invisible. Each tent is big enough for four people, and could easily be re-pitched. Perceptive characters might find some forgotten gear amid the ruined camp.
6. A jumbled field of boulders stretches for several hundred feet. The largest stones provide shelter from the biting wind but are spread among their smaller brethren. If the party use the large boulders as shelter, they will be more spread out than normal.
7. A tangle of snow-shrouded low trees and thick bushes hide a disused wolf den. The dense, tangled vegetation keeps the worst of the snow at bay and provides a modicum of insulation. Gnawed bones and clumps of fur dot the ground, in the den.
8. A high and wide cairn of piled stone juts through the snow. Someone has camped here before and has excavated a large hollow in the cairn's leeward side. The hollow is big enough for the party, but not their mounts. This cairn could be the source of a mini-adventure. Whoever excavated the hollow almost reached the mouth of a deep shaft under the cairn. Far below lie the unquiet dead of an elder civilisation. If the characters dislodge a few key stones, they discover the shaft (perhaps by falling into it). 





## LOCAL LANDMARKS 



1. The Frozen Tower: This glistening icy pillar thrusts skyward like the tusk of some gigantic, fantastical monster. At the pillar's heart stands a slender, frozen wizard's tower. Unimaginative locals name the place the Frozen Tower. During the summer months, when the sun burns bright, meltwater runs down the pillar's flanks. If the sun is intense enough, the upper part of the pillar melts away to reveal the Frozen Tower's roof. Rumours tell of adventuring parties exploring the tower during such times. None emerged before the tower refroze.
2. The Pallid Forest: Pale and sickly elm trees fill this narrow, snow-choked valley. Even the wind seems to shun this place. Here, explorers find few animal tracks in the soft, powdery snow. Dense freezing fog lingers amid the boles. The Pallid Forest is not a place for ill-equipped or inexperienced parties to explore. Rumours of a huge white serpent of unknown, but doubtless horrible, origin dwelling in the forest refuse to die, among locals.
3. The Frigid Falls: Tumbling over a frozen cliff, the Frigid Falls scintillate in the morning sun. Almost 100-foot high the falls and the frozen pool at their base are an impressive sight. A tunnel and cave behind the waterfall burrow deep into the hills, and within a passable camp can be set. The tunnel and spacious cave are warmer than the surrounds and a well-known camping spot.
4. The Hoary Old Man: Erected centuries ago, this massive statue of a warrior king stands atop a high domed hill. The statue is old and weather-worn. Various rumours identify the statue as a golem and whisper of burial chambers buried deep beneath its feet. Wreathed in frost and snow, the statue resembles a frost giant warrior.
5. The Devil's Leap: This narrow, deep gorge cuts its way through the land. Ancient tales tell of an epic battle between a hero and devil at the gorge's edge. The devil leapt across the gorge to escape the hero who built a bridge to give chase. A narrow span of unworked rock crosses the gorge and it is this feature that gave rise to the legend. When the wind howls in winter's depths only an idiot, or someone truly desperate to cross, would use the narrow, ice-slick bridge.
6. The Ashen Lake and the Twelve Sisters: A dozen slender rocky spires thrust upwards from the Ashen Lake's frozen waters. The Ashen Lake is unknowable deep, which makes the Twelve Sisters tall in the extreme. With the lake's water frozen reaching the spires is a simple matter for determined explorers. The sisters appear of natural origin to casual viewers. Perceptive dwarves examining the spires report marks in the rocks suggestive of ancient, skilled artifice.
7. The White Wyrm: Viewed from a certain angle this icy, snow-dusted rock resembles a rearing dragon frozen as it breathes on its foes. A legion of legends clusters about the White Wyrm. Most such stories deal with the dragon returning to life to ravage the surrounding lands. Sometimes treasure hunters dig below the White Wyrm. Some do not return.
8. The Boiling Pools of Krorz: Lying in a shallow depression, these three pools boil and steam no matter the surrounding temperature. Fed by deep, warm springs the pools are a magnet for travellers and wildlife. The steam given off by the pools is visible for miles, making them easy to find.
9. The Black Keep: This tumbled and ruined shell keep overlooks an old trade route. Little remains of the keep's internal structure, but its outer walls yet keep the wind and snow at bay. The keep's blackened, scorched stones tell of a ferocious fire that destroyed the place years ago. Travellers often camp at the keep, but vague rumours of murder and a cult keep casual visitors away.
10. Bleak Hill: The surrounding hills and rugged uplands channel the prevailing winds over Bleak Hill. Standing stark and grey above the surrounding snow Bleak Hill is a cold, bitter place. The winds tearing at the hill blow away fallen snow and leave nothing but bare rock and patches of lichen and moss.
11. The Nose: A shelf of bare rock juts outwards from a low hill. Twin caves pierce the shelf's base and give the feature its name. The caves are deep and offer shelter from the wind. Deep snowdrifts often block the cave's entrances. Travellers should beware: hibernating bears and wolf packs often lair in the caves.
12. The Serpent's Way: Worn by countless feet, the Serpent's Way takes a circuitous route. Following the land's natural folds, the path is wide enough for donkeys and horses, but not carts and the like. Although sheltered from the wind, heavy snowfall can still block the path. 





## MINOR DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. The distant howling of wolves reaches the characters' ears. The sporadic howling continues for hours on end and takes on a mournful tone. The wolves get no closer to the party.
2. Dark low-hanging clouds unleash a burst of heavy snow. The snow obscures the party's vision and slows their progress. Party members wandering away from the group could become separated.
3. The party discover fresh tracks in the snow. A tracker can identify the tracks as a single human-sized humanoid leading a horse. Occasional flecks of bright red blood on the white snow show at least one of the two is injured.
4. The frozen corpse of a naked man lies face-down in the snow. The body bears no obvious injuries.
5. A frozen waterfall and stream lie astride the party's path. An ice-slick clapper-style bridge crosses the stream. Although an incautious party member could slip from the bridge, there is no real danger here. The stream is only two-foot deep and almost completely frozen.
6. Gusts of wind birth snow devils that dance and weave across the snow. Several of the devils blow toward the party, but the wind pushes them away at the last moment. When the wind dies, the snow devils settle to the ground.
7. A small herd of reindeer graze amid the snow. The beasts are skinny and hungry but alert to danger. If approached—except by a druid, ranger or elf—the herd bolts. Bolting animals disappear over a nearby rise.
8. The party discovers a line of gigantic footsteps pushed deep into the snow. Made by a giant humanoid, the tracks disappear over a hill. Some drifting snow has settled in the tracks, suggesting they aren't freshly made.
9. A puddle of frozen blood mars the snow. Standing in stark contrast to the snow, the crimson puddle is visible from a far distance. The snow around the frozen blood is churned up, suggesting a battle. Judging by the amount of blood, someone or something died here.
10. As the party passes a frozen, tree-shrouded stand of trees the creaking of wood fills the air. As they watch, a tree collapses under the weight of the snow covering its crown. Investigation reveals the tree was diseased.
11. Without warning, the ground bucks violently as a minor earthquake strikes. Stones are smashed and trees are dashed to the ground. Birds take wing and other animals scatter. The shaking lasts only moments but leaves an unnatural silence in its aftermath.
12. A white hare hops through the snow. Unconcerned by the party, it is hunting for food and ignores anyone more than 20 feet away. The hare could make a tasty addition to the party's rations, and a tracker could follow its trail back to its warren. 

## MINOR NIGHTTIME EVENTS 



1. A scintillating array of vivid colours plays across the sky. The display is breathtaking. The intertwined arcs of red and yellow light are so bright, even humans can see as if it were day.
2. A distant glimmering light on the horizon marks another campsite. The light shines brightly for the first few hours but fades away as the night wears on.
3. The wind howls about the camp, plucking at the party's tents and hurling snow into the face of anyone outside. In the dead of night, the wind picks up and screams about the camp like a demented banshee. By morning, the wind drops away and the characters must dig themselves out of their tents.
4. Occasional, distant, inhuman howling reaches the party's ears. It sounds like the screeching of a large animal but comes from far off. Later that night, the howling comes from the opposite direction and is much closer.
5. A bubble of frigid air settles over the camp, and the temperature drops sharply. The sentry's breath freezes in the air and frost forms on their eyebrows and nose.
6. The moon hangs low in the clear, cloudless sky, reflecting bright light over the party's snowy camp. This light persists all night. It is hard for the party to sleep but also difficult for anyone or anything to creep up on the resting characters.
7. A white-furred fox scampers through camp looking for morsels of food. The fox is hungry and can be hand-fed by a patient, non-threatening character.
8. The party has camped over a hares' warren. During the night, the timid creatures emerge to hunt for food buried beneath the snow. (White-furred wolves in the area may know of the warren and also make an appearance during the night. Unless they are starving, the wolves watch the camp from a distance and do not attack).
9. As dawn breaks, a flight of three white geese with blacktipped wings soars above the camp. They fly in the direction the party plan to travel. Could this be an omen?
10. Light snow falls all night, obscuring the party's tracks and covering the party's tents. At dawn, the surrounds are white, pristine and pure.
11. An awe-inspiring display of scintillating colour illuminates the night sky. Brightening the land with an incredible rainbow of colours, the lights lasts only a few minutes. The show illuminates several large shapes moving across the tundra.
12. A snowy white owl glides soundlessly above the party. If one of the heroes has a small animal companion or other pet, the owl might pounce. An attack by such a silent predator is likely to take the party by surprise. 





## WILDERNESS DRESSING 



1. A frozen lake lies beneath a thin layer of virgin snow. The snow hides the lake's extent and the ice's thickness. An investigation may reveal holes cut in the ice, perhaps for fishing or some other purpose.
2. A lonely snowman watches over the featureless land. Charcoal shards serve as its eyes and nose, and old buttons adorn the snowman's torso. A small tattered red and orange scarf around the snowman's neck flutters in the breeze.
3. A dome of packed snow and ice stands proud amid deep drifts of snow. No obvious openings pierce the dome, but the heaped snow could hide its entrance.
4. Three hardy sheep, with thick off-white fleeces, graze on the grass buried under the snow. The sheep's massive gnarled horns look dangerous but belie their passive nature. The animals completely ignore anyone approaching them.
5. A strange red and orange waterfall tumbles out of a cave in a high hill. The water plunges into a pitch-black hole at the hill's base. The snow around the waterfall is stained, and an odour like the smell of fresh blood fills the air.
6. A whining sound reveals a shivering dog curled up in the snow. Weeping scars from a whip are raw upon its back, and it lies on the ground as if concealing another injury. The dog has lain here for some time and is unlikely to survive much longer without aid.
7. Patches of odd-coloured pink, green, yellow and blue snow dot the barren land. The patches are slightly iridescent and have an unpleasant taste. Nearby is a weather-worn sign that suggests one should only eat the yellow snow.
8. Steam wafts up from a small pond covered with thick, lumpy bright-green algae. The water is warm, but the air around reeks of rotten eggs.
9. Huge boulders litter the ground; a large tree lies cracked and broken on the snow amongst them. A search reveal several more boulders piled in a spot more than a hundred yards away.
10. The deep tracks of a local predator advance through the snow, though are larger than u s u a l . M u c h larger. The tracks disappear into a snowdrift. Thus, it is unclear if the creature is still nearby.
11. The air is much warmer around a pool of hot, bubbling water. The surrounding snow is slush. The source of the heat seems to be a barely visible staff or rod sunk deep in the pool.
12. The corpses of two fearsome predators lie frozen together in their death throes. There is no hint of the well-preserved bodies' age.
13. A small green and yellow-leafed tree stands stark against the white of the surrounding snow. Curiously, no snow or ice rests on the tree's leaves or branches.
14. Recent rain has frozen on the icy ground, leaving a myriad of strange pillars reaching up towards the sky. One of these pillars is more than five feet in height, stretching upwards like a titan's finger.
15. The remains of a hasty camp sprawl in the lee of a hill. Several low tunnels have been dug into the snowbank, offering shelter from the elements. The entrances all face a single extinguished campfire whose ashes are still warm to the touch.
16. A field of frozen flowers spreads across the snow, creating a bright spray of colour. The flowers' beauty is fragile, and they shatter if touched. The extreme cold has frozen the flowers to their cores.
17. An enormous humanoid skull lies amid a field of icecovered stones. Rotting wooden planks block some of the holes piercing the skull. Soot and graffiti suggest the skull has served as a shelter in the past.
18. An array of well-camouflaged holes dot the snow. They resemble rabbit holes, but scraps of skin and small bones suggest something less benign lurks within.
19. A cache of hunting equipment waits here for its owner to reclaim it. Freshly skinned hides fill an oiled sack, and both the crossbow and traps bear signs of recent use.
20. A pile of a half-dozen tree trunks lie in the shelter of a stand of trees. A well-used iron axe is embedded in a stump, and sledge tracks scar the ground. 





## UNEVENTFUL TRAVEL 



1. The day is cold and clear. A light breeze blows into the characters' faces for much of the morning. The wind dies in the afternoon before returning at dusk—the temperature plunges when the sun goes down.
2. Light snow falls for much of the day, obscuring the party's tracks. The characters see no other travellers but do discover a sizeable wolf pack's tracks late in the day. Of the wolves, there is no other sign.
3. Despite a pale, wan sun, the temperature never gets above freezing. The party slog through trackless snow, all day. They see no other living things except a few birds wheeling far above. The party ends the day cold, hungry and tired.
4. A light freezing mist hugs the ground, as the party breaks camp. The mist doesn't obscure vision but lingers all day. Dark clouds arrive in the mid-afternoon, and dusk comes early.
5. A few birds wheel high up in the clear, blue sky. The birds shadow the party for several hours before something far away distracts them. Light clouds scud across the sky, but no snow falls. A light breeze begins in the late afternoon. As dusk falls, the wind picks up and hurls light snow at the party.
6. The temperature is several degrees warmer, today. By midday, some ice and snow begin to melt, and the sound of dripping water assails the party. In the late afternoon, the temperature plummets below zero.
7. At dawn, a chill wind strikes the party's camp, whipping up the freshly fallen snow. After a few hours, the wind stills. Sporadic flurries of snow strike the party during the day, and as dusk falls, heavy snow begins to fall. By morning, the party's tracks are wholly obscured.
8. Mist hovers over the land, in the morning. The mist seems to shimmer in the rising sun's sharp rays. The sun burns the mist away by mid-morning, but dark clouds gather in the early afternoon. Scudding by far overhead, the clouds plunge the travellers into shade. The temperature drops below zero. 





# SUBTERRANEAN MINE 







## THINGS TO FIND IN A MINE 



1. The tunnel floor is marred with deep ruts worn by steelclad wooden cartwheels. Slippery moss grows in patches between the ruts.
2. A pulley hangs from the ceiling. The rope dangling from it has an empty wooden bucket tied to one end. The other disappears into a deep shaft in the floor.
3. A donkey cart sits to one side with its harness still attached. It contains three days' worth of dry rations for four people.
4. Small recesses at head height, one every ten-foot or so, line the walls. One contains a metal lantern that emits a cool, pale light that can't be extinguished.
5. The floor ahead is littered with diamond shards that glitter like stars. There is about 50 gp worth of diamond bits, but collecting them takes 30 minutes.
6. A small metal cage dangles from a metal hook driven into the tunnel's ceiling. A brightly coloured but miserable-looking bird sits on a perch inside.
7. A six-foot stick lies along the wall. It has a half-used candle lashed to one end.
8. This passage boasts a few large wooden support beams. One lies unfinished across the floor in a pool of oddly coloured water.
9. Warm, dry air flows through this part of the mine. A shaft in the ceiling cuts straight up to daylight above.
10. Short-hafted hammers, pickaxes and shovels lean against the walls in this half-finished tunnel, waiting for the workers' return.
11. A group of hand baskets sit here, full of ore ready to be carried from the mine.
12. A low shaft slants off to the right. A drum with two crank handles sits four-foot back from its opening, wrapped in a rope that disappears into the darkness below.
13. Atop a pile of rubble sits an old, battered warrior's helm modified to hold a candle just over the brow.
14. Knocking sounds seem to come from behind the walls and ceiling. All non-magical lights gutter out in this area.
15. The floor drops away suddenly. A wooden ladder enables access to the lower level.
16. A pile of charcoal lies on the floor of an alcove. The wall and ceiling are black with soot.
17. Off to the side sits a wheelbarrow with a single metal wheel. The barrow is full of fist-sized chunks of rock.
18. The walls are worked with such delicacy that they are smooth as glass to the touch; this must have required a significant amount of time, but there seems to be no reason why anyone would expend that much effort.
19. The floor slopes down into a lower area full of a strong, sour gas smell. One minute spent in the area probably causes any creature to become sickened; after ten minutes, they could lose consciousness.
20. A crude sign nailed to a support beam says “For the Knockers”. Under the sign, a pile of half-eaten food in various states of decay covers the floor. 

## LOOTING A MINER 



1. The stubs of a dozen candles fill the miner's pouch.
2. A scrap of cloth is wrapped around a tiny nub of jerky (of unidentifiable meat).
3. Small pieces of rock—some containing tiny amount of glittering metal—fills the miner's pouch.
4. An empty oil flask and a belt pouch holding a tinder box and a ragged, sweat-stained dirty cloth hang from the miner's belt.
5. This miner wore a pack containing a carefully wrapped set of spare clothes that are surprisingly clean.
6. This miner carried a pickaxe strapped to his back; the pick is surprisingly light, and its haft is made of some incredibly tough, light wood.
7. Several nubs of chalk, along with a half-empty water flask, fill the miner's pouch.
8. The miner wears small silver earrings (worth 10 gp) shaped like teardrops.
9. This miner's boots are well made; the leather is rigid and inflexible and provides good protection against small falling rocks.
10. This miner carried a rolled-up bundle of chisels along with a light hammer in his pouch. All are in good condition and well maintained.
11. A plain iron chain hangs around this miner's neck. The miniature symbols of various gods—those dealing with darkness, mining, the underground and so on—hang from the chain.
12. This miner had a decent pair of leather gloves stuffed through his wide belt. Much used, the gloves are thick and provide good protection. 





## THINGS IN AN ABANDONED MINE 



1. The haft of a pickaxe lies on the floor. Nearby, the rest of it is embedded in a wall.
2. A bucket filled with rubble stands against a wall. Stuffed between it and the wall is a shard of seemingly unremarkable rock wrapped in a shredded dirty sack.
3. An (inanimate) skeletal arm clad in rags emerges from a caved-in section of the tunnel.
4. A cart lies on its side. It partially blocks the tunnel, and rubble lies all about.
5. Water drips down from the ceiling forming a small pool on the floor.
6. A wooden roof support has collapsed and fallen to the ground. Ominously, a small pile of rubble lies around the fallen post, perhaps hints the roof is unstable.
7. An iron bar gate blocks off access to a side tunnel. The gate is old, and its lock is rusted into immobility. Beyond the passageway extends ten feet before turning east.
8. Minerals in the tunnel's walls glimmer in the party's lights. They are worthless but pretty.
9. A sinkhole pierces the passage's floor, blocking further progress. The sinkhole is five-foot-wide and 120 ft. deep. Danger lurks here, for the far side of the sinkhole is unstable; anyone jumping across and landing within five-foot of the edge causes an additional collapse, which drops them into the lightless depths.
10. Phosphorescent mould grows along one wall and part of the ceiling. The mould is green a n d h a rml e s s . O b s e r v a n t adventurers notice i t s e e m s t o u n d u l a t e gently. (Its thick growth obscures s e v e r a l s m a l l worked holes in the wall that lead to an air shaft).
11. A barrel full of rusting mining equipment—picks, spades and so on—stands in an alcove. The equipment is worthless and rapidly falls apart if used.
12. A shaft pierces the ceiling. It links up with an upper level. A faint cold breeze issues from the shaft, and— occasionally—strange sounds are also discernible.
13. From somewhere far away comes the sounds of miners at work. Later, the party comes across an area of the tunnel where the air is full of rock dust. Of the miners, there is no sign.
14. A rotting chest stands in an alcove. Within linger the remains of rations and several desiccated water flasks.
15. A pony's skeletal remains lie in front of an overturned mine cart. The cart partially blocks the passageway. Examination of the skeleton reveals the animal likely broke a leg and was left here to die.
16. Deep cracks pierce the ceiling of a large section of the tunnel. As the characters approach the area, the rocks groan alarmingly, and dust sifts down from above.
17. Thick spider webs cover the entrance to a side tunnel. A faint, unpleasant smell emerges from the tunnel. The spider is long dead, but the desiccated remains of its victims yet remain.
18. A ripped and torn backpack lies in the deep dust covering the floor. Dried blood covers the back portion of the pack (which is empty).
19. Here, the miners carved several niches in the tunnel wall and filled them with candles and votive offerings to the various gods of the underworld. All are covered in dust but, along with many partially burnt candles, looters can recover 15 gp in old mixed coinage.
20. Up head, the tunnel splits in two and goes around a large column of tremendously dense rock. A whitewashed arrow points down one tunnel. 





## THINGS IN A MINE CART 



1. Rocks fill this cart.
2. Half full of rocks, water dripping down from the ceiling has filled the balance of the cart.
3. This cart is empty, but for a pair of pickaxes.
4. The white bones of a dead miner clad in dusty, torn clothes lie in the bottom of this mine cart.
5. A half-dozen sturdy pieces of lumber—pit props—stick out of this cart, nearly touching the ceiling.
6. Filled with a mix of mining equipment, this cart contains two small lanterns, four flasks of oil and a broken pick.
7. A slab of rock fills this cart; the miners discovered a small silver deposit, but this lies in the rock's underside and isn't visible unless the rock is tipped out of the cart.
8. The traces for a pit pony are still attached to this cart, but of the pony, there is no sign.
9. Gravel fills this cart to the brim.
10. A fine lair of cobwebs clings to the wheels of this cart, indicating it has not moved for quite some time.
11. A smear of dried blood coats the front of this cart.
12. The white rock filling this cart is of a different type to that found in most of the mine; the deposit from whence it came lies far away.
13. A tarpaulin covers this cart. Under it lie mouldering foodstuffs as well as some torches and candles.
14. As #13 but water dripping from above has rendered the torches and candles useless.
15. A large bag of nails and various lengths of thick wood fills this cart. Atop the wood lie several large hammers.
16. This cart holds a dozen or so broken picks, shovels and so on.
17. A precarious pile of rocks fills this cart; if the cart moves, some tumble out with a loud clatter.
18. This rusty cart lies on its side; the bottom falls out if any appreciable weight is placed inside.
19. This upside-down cart is missing one of its wheels.
20. A bizarre mishmash of bones fills this cart; they don't seem to have come from a humanoid. 

## PERILS IN A MINE 



1. A boarded-over hole in the floor is hidden under a thick layer of dust and rubble. The boards collapse under any significant weight and drop the hapless explorer into a smooth, steep chute that deposits them into a chamber on a lower level.
2. A ragged hole in the tunnel wall is blocked by the skeletal remains of some poor unfortunate miner; his arms are outstretched into the tunnel and may snag an unwary explorer. A large chamber lies beyond the hole; the air within becomes increasingly noxious the further inside one ventures.
3. A large pool of water covers the tunnel floor. The tunnel has flooded from below; a deep shaft at the bottom of the pool links the tunnel with a large flooded chamber with numerous exits.
4. The recently deceased corpse of a prospector or explorer leans against an abandoned mine cart filled with bones. The strangely desiccated corpse is discoloured and disfigured, clear signs of the virulent disease that awaits anyone foolish enough to investigate too closely.
5. A large hole with smooth sides in the tunnel floor hinders further progress. Likely made by some large burrowing creature, it drops straight down before curving out of sight. Anyone within 5 feet of the hole runs the risk of the broken, crumbling edge giving way beneath their feet.
6. Thick, sticky webbing fills a long section of tunnel. The webs can be burned away quickly, but this fills the tunnel with a thick, foul-smelling haze.
7. A rickety rope bridge spans a seemingly bottomless 20- foot wide chasm. Anyone attempting to cross the bridge without first making necessary repairs to it is in danger of it giving way beneath their feet.
8. A tunnel with moist walls overgrown with pale blue fungus induces a soporific effect on creatures breathing the damp air. Creatures spending more than a few minutes in the tunnel fall into a deep slumber.
9. A stream cuts across the tunnel ahead, exiting through a large hole near the tunnel wall and dropping away into the unknown. Crossing the stream means contending with fast-flowing cold water and a slippery streambed that could sweep the unwary into the depths. After rain, the stream becomes a raging torrent.
10. An explosive pocket of gas fills this area. It instantly ignites when any sort of flame or strong heat source is introduced. Cautious explorers might note the area's fireblackened walls, floor and ceiling.
11. A set of old, rusted mining cart tracks leads into a black tunnel that doesn't seem to permit natural light of any sort. The darkness is impenetrable to normal light.
12. The tunnel walls are veined with a singular type of crystal that refracts and reflects light in myriad directions, making it difficult to see. Creatures relying on sight may find themselves at a disadvantage trying to navigate or defend themselves in such tunnels. 





## HAUNTINGS 



1. A billowing cloud of smoke hurtles down the tunnel, leaving those caught within it gasping for air and unable to see. It dissipates just as quickly as it appears, leaving behind the lingering smell of charred flesh.
2. A tunnel floor of dried mud entombs the partial remains of several skeletons. The sound of rushing water with no apparent source fills the air.
3. The distant clanging of a hand bell comes from behind the party as whispering voices seem to pass by headed in its direction.
4. A wooden crosspiece with a hangman's noose suspended from it spans the bottom of a ventilation shaft. It sways gently in a non-existent breeze, and faint choking sounds can be heard.
5. A small bird noiselessly flies into sight out of the darkness and crashes to the tunnel floor. It weakly flutters about before lying still and disappearing.
6. The sound of heavy footsteps accompanies the party as they traverse a certain tunnel. It sounds as if someone wearing heavy boots is walking alongside the characters. Moist footprints appear on the stone floor before quickly fading away.
7. An overturned wheelbarrow, surrounded by a low cloud of dust, comes into view. The upturned wheel is still spinning as if the upset had just occurred.
8. The ghostly visage of a sobbing miner kneels against the wall, staring deeper into the mine. When approached, he suddenly stands and runs into the darkness.
9. Shadows cast by the party's lights take on the form of hunched miners wielding various mining implements. They become locked in battle with one another before fading away to nothingness. Dried blood covers the tunnel walls.
10. Light from several torches crosses a distant intersection, accompanied by the echoing sound of conversation.
11. A rumbling sound begins to crescendo and culminates in what sounds like a cave-in, followed by muffled and fading screams.
12. Twisted and leering faces seem to take shape in the walls, out of the corner of the characters' eyes. The faces disappear, if anyone looks at them.
13. A light mist forms and follows the explorers. It eventually coalesces into a roughly humanoid form that motions them to silence by bringing a finger to its mouth. It then fades away.
14. The faint smell of noxious gas reaches the characters' nostrils, followed by the hazy outlines of choking faces that fade in and out of view and the very limit of the party's lights.
15. Two rows of chains hang from the tunnel roof, dropping down to just short of the floor. They begin swaying and rattling as if something just ran between them.
16. A skeletal figure lies sprawled at an intersection, one arm pointing towards a side tunnel. Anyone approaching feels a dramatic drop in temperature and the unmistakable feeling of being watched.
17. A voice cries out as the ghastly visage of a large rat swarm comes into view. The swarm disperses and fades away, revealing the mauled remains of a miner lying sprawled on the floor.
18. Glints of gold seem evident now and then in a small stream trickling past. When investigated, the water swirls with blood and becomes littered with bones.
19. A pillar of sunlight streams in from a ventilation shaft piercing the ceiling above an intersection. Spectral miners are occasionally outlined as they pass through the patchy of faint light.
20. Small blue flames lead explorers to an isolated alcove with a narrow vertical shaft in the floor. The mouldering offerings of the miners cast into the depths fill the bottom half of the shaft. 

## STRANGE SOUNDS 



1. The faint rhythmic sound of metal on stone reaches the party's ears. The mine's acoustics make it hard to determine from which direction the sound is coming.
2. The clatter of rocks heralds several stones falling from the ceiling in an unstable part of the mine.
3. The sound of running water comes from behind a wall.
4. The pitter-patter of dripping water hints at a wet section of the tunnel ahead.
5. A rumbling roar marks a major rockfall somewhere in the distant mine.
6. Barely audible distant singing, in an indistinct language, echoes through the mine.
7. A faint moan grows louder and louder until the area the characters are in is filled with a great gust of wind. As quickly as it arrives, the wind subsides.
8. A cackling sound—akin to a madman's ravings—sounds from somewhere in the darkness.
9. The clip-clop of hooves on stone betrays the presence of a beast of burden somewhere in the vicinity.
10. A dull roar echoes through the mine; the sound is so intense rock dust sifts down from the ceiling. 





## STRANGE DISCOVERIES 



1. Massive yellowed bones line the walls ahead; this passage weaves through the ribcage and emerges through the jaws of a gigantic ancient dragon skeleton.
2. Thousands of rat skulls comprise the tunnel's walls for nearly a hundred feet. Millennia have turned them to stone, and some have grown stalactites.
3. Waves of heat and choking gases pour from a tunnel offshoot. A dull red glow suggests magma flows somewhere beyond.
4. A giant mirrored piece of metal blocks the passage. It is impossible to say if the object is natural or crafted.
5. A thousand holy symbols of forgotten religions fill a shallow pit in a small off-shoot tunnel.
6. Mild acid drips from the ceiling and pools on the floor before continuing its journey through the rock. The acid irritates the skin but is otherwise harmless.
7. The sound of rushing water suggests an underground stream up ahead, but the liquid dripping from the walls is blood red and smells of copper.
8. Two desiccated miners' corpses lie frozen in fatal conflict. Between them sits a fist-sized lump of pyrite, or “fool's gold.”
9. For several hundred feet, the tunnel is carved through a deposit of sparkling white quartz. The quartz is worthless —it crumbles if chipped from the walls—but dazzling in such concentration.
10. A deep sonic pulse echoes through the mine, every few minutes. The pulse is barely audible but causes dust and grit to sift down from the ceiling. It is irregular and ceases before the characters confirm its point of origin.
11. A dense blue mist sublimates from the walls, filling the tunnel and obscuring vision beyond five feet. The mist smells oddly sweet and leaves a sticky residue on everything it touches.
12. The characters' metal equipment pulls them towards the walls where lumps of magnetic lodestone jut from the unworked rock.
13. A pit drops 30 feet onto the massive upturned threeeyed head of a hideous stone idol of alien aspect. The remainder of the statue remains buried—deliberately.
14. The walls are covered in soot except for the morbid silhouettes of several humanoid figures.
15. The tunnel passes through a house-sized cavern, wherein a giant lies interred. His bony hands still clutch a stone club, and he is adorned with an obsidian crown untouched by time.
16. A dozen pottery shards are partially embedded in the walls. The markings are ancient and belong to no culture the characters recognise.
17. A rusted mass of springs and spikes pins an ancient desiccated corpse to a wall. Perhaps this is a trap—or some terrible punishment—from a forgotten age.
18. Thin veins of iron spiral around the tunnel walls. They spark with electricity but are harmless.
19. The air hangs thick with humidity, and one wall is boiling hot. The sound of rushing water from beyond the wall drowns out all but shouted conversation.
20. Off the main path, well-worn green steps lead down to a solid wall of onyx. Judging by their steep angle and massive size, this stair was not hewn for human feet. 

## STRANGE SMELLS 



1. A dank, mouldy smell fills this area. Investigation reveals several of the pit props are rotten.
2. This whole area smells strongly of urine. A large, suspicious stain on the wall suggests some kind of large creature recently relieved itself here.
3. The stale, fetid smell of sweat hangs in the air. The scent is strongest in a small alcove low down to the floor.
4. A sudden gust of air brings smells wholly out of place in a mine: the smell of smoke and cooking meat.
5. An indistinct haze and the faint smell of ozone hangs in the air. The haze isn't thick enough to obscure vision.
6. The overpowering, heavy stench of some noxious chemical—perhaps a poisonous gas—fills this area. Those breathing in the smell get a cloying nauseous feeling in their throats and could become violently sick.
7. A strange off-white mould with long, fibrous tendrils clings to this wet patch of tunnel wall; the stench of rot fills the air.
8. The water dripping down into the tunnel reacts with the metals in the rock to create a mild metallic smell.
9. The pit props in this section of mine are charred, and the stench of smoke hangs heavily in the air. Perceptive characters may also detect the faint smell of burnt flesh.
10. The surprisingly out of place cloying scent of expensive lady's perfume fills the passageway. 





# SUN-SCORCHED DESERT 



## SUN-SCORCHED LANDMARKS 



1. A deep, 40-foot-wide chasm cuts through sand like a gigantic, jagged wound. Its precipitous sides drop over fifty feet into cool shadow. Below, the remains of a river course are visible amid the sand and boulders.
2. Visible from a great distance, a high hill rears upwards toward the sky. Deep drifts of sand on its windward side provide a ramp of sorts against its steep, pitted flank. Its flat summit is clear of vegetation and sand but is dominated by deep carvings of complex geometric shapes. Cut by unknown hands, anyone viewing them from the air realises the shapes form an enormous pentagram. Characters with arcane knowledge can confirm the pentagram's design is designed to trap something within.
3. An immense star-shaped dune—formed by the complex interplay of wind in this region—rears from its surrounds like some gigantic, otherworldly beast. Almost 200-foot high, it is an excellent vantage point, and its long ridges provide shelter from the savage winds ravaging the surrounding sands.
4. The wind- and sand-blasted stone head of a gnoll yet struggles above the shifting sands. The head—the size of an elder wyrm's—hints at a vast buried statue beneath the sand. Whatever the truth, the figure is obviously ancient— much of the face's fine detail is no more-eroded by the remorseless wind and sand.
5. An oasis of blessedly clear water nestles in a wide chasm emerging from a small range of low, nameless hills. Dates and palms cluster thickly about the long, narrow pool. Caves—clearly cut into the rock with hand tools— pierce the chasm's walls and provide resting places for travellers. A hermit dwells in one of the caves.
6. The bleached bones of a gigantic dragon lie sprawled along a long, low hill. Slain centuries ago by the great battle-mage Kardath Uvo, the remains are those of Atar- Unar. Knowledgeable characters recall Atar-Unar's lair (and treasure) remain lost. Rumours speak of strange sounds emanating from the hilltop and of lightning arcing down from the cloudless sky to strike the bones. Consequently, few travellers tarry here long. 

## SUN-SCORCHED RUINS 



1. The broken remains of a long, low stone wall disappear into the base of a dune. Scoured by sand and wind, the wall is fragile; only the inertia of ages holds it together.
2. A set of carven stone steps set into a low hill disappear downwards into a steep-sided, sand-choked depression. Attempts to dig out the depression result in more sand tumbling into the hole from above. Perceptive characters investigating the steps discover faint carvings depicting a grand procession of people carrying a sarcophagus down a long set of steps into a deep, hidden crypt.
3. The desert's shifting sands have revealed a ceremonial corpse way flanked by evenly placed stone obelisks. Once elaborately carved to represent the deads' journey to the afterlife, they are all but rubbed smooth by the sand's remorseless action. Still, sharp-eyed characters may be able to make out some of the lurid carvings depicting skeletons, demons and other unidentifiable winged creatures.
4. The broken crenulations of a tower peak through the shifting sand. Thanks to its stone shutters, the tower's upper chambers—accessibly through a trapdoor in the roof—are mainly free of sand. Inside, it is dark and comparatively cool.
5. The shell-like remains of a small village are arrayed along a dried-up riverbed, which emerges from a sandchoked cave. Nothing now lives in the village except for scorpions and a few snakes. Digging in, or searching the, ruins inevitably draw their attention. Even a cursory search throws up a surprising amount of skeletal humanoid remains among the ruins.
6. Amid a belt of arid wasteland, a ring of forlorn stone obelisks stands stark atop a lonely, steep-sided hill. Visible for miles in every direction, the obelisks could have once been a temple, celestial observatory or other sacred place. Investigations reveal the “ring” to actually be a strangely squashed oval and that each obelisk to be vaguely triangular shaped. A steep-sided shaft pierces the hill's rocky summit, at the centre of the “ring”. Invisible from above—due to the shaft's immense depth— a pool of clean and fresh drinking water fills a cavern deep below the hill. 




## DESERT DRESSING 



1. The sun stands high in the air, and heat shimmers rise from the sun-baked sand. Far off in the distance, black specks circle high up in the air.
2. A gust of wind plucks at the crest of a nearby dune, sending a shimmering cloud of fine sand dancing through the air.
3. Far off on the horizon, a line of tiny black figures trudging along a dune is silhouetted against the deep blue sky. Shortly, they disappear behind the dunes.
4. Ahead, two towering dunes form the flanks of a deep valley wreathed in cool shade.
5. A short line of footprints mars the desert sand. Rendered indistinct by drifting sand, they peter out after a hundred yards or so.
6. A dried-out, sand-choked oasis lies at the base of a small dune. Two dead palm trees lie on their sides, partially buried in drifting sand.
7. A metal pot helmet—scorchingly hot to the touch—lies on the ground, partially filled with sand.
8. The corpse of a desiccated camel lies in the sand. Two hungry vultures peck and tear at its hard, sandy flesh. If disturbed, the vultures fly off a short distance. They wait for the party to move on before returning to their feast.
9. Dark clouds—pushed by fiercely strong winds high up in the sky—rush over the party. Far off in the distance, they lose their precious water over a range of steep-sided, parched hills whose narrow valleys are soon scoured by flash flooding.
10. Here lie the wind-blasted remains of some ancient battle. The desiccated corpses of two hyena-headed humanoids (gnolls) lie locked in an eternal embrace with a swarthy, now partially mummified, human warrior.
11. Set in a dune's lea and partially covered in drifting sand lies the collapsed remains of a large white tent. Its poles have collapsed, but lumps in the canvas betray the presence of objects within. The characters can recover a usable saddle, four empty waterskins and various other odds and ends.
12. The raucous cawing of several birds alerts the characters to the presence of several buzzards perched atop a nearby dune. They watch the party hungrily. If not driven off, they follow the characters for the balance of the day but lose interest in the cool of the evening.
13. The lonely and forlorn, sun-basted skeleton of some vast tusked creature—perhaps an elephant—lies partially buried in the side of a dune.
14. The party pass through a small field of stunted, sickly thorn bushes punctuated by the occasional cactus. Unwary characters might disturb several snakes resting in the bushes' shadows. The snakes slither away unless cornered or attacked.
15. Incongruously, the stark, leafless trunk and far-flung branches of a mighty tree struggle above the shifting sands. The tree is vast—and must have deep-reaching roots to have survived. Several desiccated, partmummified corpses dangle from nooses hanging from the tree's branches. They sway gently in the faint wind.
16. From far off to the party's right, the glint of sunlight reflecting off something catches one of the character's attention. Investigations reveal a man-sized shard of wind-smoothed flint thrusting up through the sand.
17. This section of the desert is barren, dry and lifeless. The wind has blown the sand away from a swath of rippled stone that extends for several miles. Tracking across the stone—seemingly frozen like waves on a beach—is virtually impossible.
18. For off in the distance, through the shimmering heat, a character spots the hazy image of a stand of palm trees clustered around a pool of blue, welcoming water.
19. A train of hazy and indistinct figures seems to glide across the horizon in front of the party.
20. On the horizon rise the purple-fringed towers and battlemented walls of a city! Even knowledgeable characters know of no such city or civilisation, but there it stands nonetheless. 




## UNEVENTFUL DAYS TRAVEL 



1. Around midday, a few wispy clouds scud by high up in the sky but provide no shade from the merciless sun.
2. The day's travel is unremarkable except for a broad swath of soft sand. With every step, the characters sink almost ankle-deep into its cloying embrace; progress through the area is torturously slow.
3. A fierce wind blows up from the south. For a few minutes, it seemed a sandstorm might be in the offing, but the winds die as quickly as they came.
4. As the party crest a dune, its peak gives way; unwary characters find themselves tumbling and sliding down its steep flank.
5. Stirred up by sporadic wisps of wind, dust devils dance about the party for much of the morning. After midday, the wind drops away to nothing, and the dust devils do not return.
6. High up in the cloudless sky, some vast winged beast flies over the party, its shadow gliding over the hot sands. The creature does not notice the party—or if it does, it ignores them.
7. Unrelenting heat is the order of the day. The air is still— almost preternaturally still—all day; around midday, the temperature reaches a new high. Travel without magical protections is virtually impossible.
8. The party travel through a particularly desolate, empty stretch of desert. They see nothing but sand, sky, and each other for the entire day. It is crushingly quiet and stiflingly hot.
9. Today, the desert is a furnace. Heat shimmers—and nothing but stark, barren sand—surround the party.
10. This day is uneventful except for a few dark clouds sliding majestically across the sky.
11. A small pack of vultures shadow the party for much of the day. Perceptive characters spot them circling several hundred feet away. They follow the group for much of the day—unless driven off—but lose interest as dusk falls over the burning sands.
12. In the early afternoon, the party crosses over the tracks of another group of travellers. Skilled trackers can tell the other party was about 20 strong, and most of them were mounted on camels.
13. In this section of the desert, the dunes are particularly densely packed with steep valleys between them. Travel, consequently, is slow.
14. In the mid-morning, the party passes a single gigantic cactus standing in the lee of a shallow, wind-swept dune.
15. Today, the characters discover a small oasis sheltering in the shadow of a low range of sun-blasted, unnamed hills. A few stunted trees and bushes survive about the pool's fringes. (This is an excellent place to replenish the party's water supplies.)
16. The party spies a small herd of wild camels grazing on a few stubborn clumps of grass growing in the valley between two dunes during the early evening. The camels are only a few hundred yards away from the party —perhaps close enough to hunt or catch!
17. During the day, the party comes across the distinctive undulating tracks of a snake in the sand. By the look of the tracks, it was a gigantic specimen.
18. About midday, the party discovers the steep banks of a long-since dried-up river. The crumbling banks are almost 20 feet high. Unless the party can cross this barrier, they must spend several hours diverting around the deep gully.
19. Clumps of grass struggle above the shifting sands of this relatively flat section of the desert through which the party pass. Toward the end of the day, they discover the tottering ruin of a small building of baked brick built into a small stony cliff.
20. During the early morning, the party crosses the cracked, dried-up bed of a small lake. Several times during the morning, they pass by small hills—once probably islands —as stark and barren as the lake bed. 





## SANDSTORM EVENTS 



1. The howling wind increases in tempo, hurling sand into the party's faces with breath-taking savagery and force. Sand cakes their eyes, fills their noses and even forces its way into their mouths.
2. The wind screeches about the party like the dying screams of some vast, mythical beast of gargantuan proportions. The howling comes from all around as if the characters were trapped in the dying beast's belly.
3. Visibility is essentially zero—all a character can see are driving curtains of sand and their companions' shadowy, indistinct forms.
4. The howling wind and storm-tossed sand fill the characters' ears, nostrils and eyes, deadening their senses. Above it all, however, the shrieking wind sings its devil song—nothing of this world could block out its horrible screech so loud is the storm's fury.
5. The wind buffets the party, driving sand into them in seemingly endless waves. Travel—slow at the best of times in a sandstorm—slows to a crawl in the face of nature's primal savagery.
6. For a moment, through the unending sheets of windflung sand, the vague hulking outline of a humanoid comes into view. A sudden deluge of sand erases the figure from sight. When the wind slightly abates a few minutes later, there is no sign of the figure (and— obviously—tracking is impossible).
7. The wind is like a living thing, plucking, pulling and tearing at the party. As it continues, it reaches new maddening heights. Dust devils—larger and more vicious than anyone has experienced before—dance about the party in a macabre, twisting dance. It is almost enough to ask if the devils are creatures dwelling amid the storm or if the storm possesses a spark of malign sentience…
8. The party are not the only travellers caught amid the storm's fury. As they stagger onwards, they come across the partially buried figure of another traveller curled up tightly in the shelter of a small dune. Unfortunately, the storm is so savage the dune is shifting and slowly burying the unconscious unfortunate.
9. Suddenly, a torrent of sand engulfs the party—the crest of a nearby dune has collapsed under the wind's savage assault. An avalanche of sand cascades over the party, burying those who lose their footing.
10. The wind's howl abates, and the sand settles to the ground in deep drifts of fine, unpacked sand. This fine sand fills several deep depressions, which now lurk ready to catch the unwary. Those blundering into such “sand traps” rapidly sink from sight. 





# SUNKEN SHIP 


## THINGS AROUND THE WRECK 



1. A school of brightly coloured fish darts about and within the wreck. When explorers arrive, the fish scatter before slowly returning to investigate the newcomers. If someone feeds the fish, they gather around that person. The fish pose no threat and may be useful as an early warning of approaching predators or other dangers.
2. Shortly after the adventurers reach the shipwreck and begin to explore, four ships sail overhead. The ships drop anchor around the wreck.
3. A mated pair of sharks patrols the area. While they are not aggressive at any explorers' approach, they draw close to the ship through apparent curiosity.
4. This shipwreck appears to be the most recent among a graveyard of a score of other wrecks.
5. Warmer than normal water temperatures support the growth of a large, active coral reef around the wreck.
6. The bloated bodies of the ship's crew float facedown above the wreck. Seabirds peck at the bloated flesh and wheel away, screeching at intruders when disturbed.
7. The current flows in circular patterns throughout the area. When it touches the seafloor, it kicks up swirling vortices of silt and water. The flow intensifies at times, producing powerful vortices taller than most humans.
8. Sunlight penetrates the water to a distance of 30 feet above the wreck, leaving the ship and its surroundings shrouded in eternal, chill darkness.
9. The scattered bones of an ancient aquatic leviathan, a creature larger than four blue whales combined, rest a quarter-mile from the wreck.
10. Phosphorescent algae bathe the site in a purple glow but don't produce substantial illumination. Fish feeding on the algae exude the same violet glow for 30 seconds after consuming the algae.
11. A pocket of numbingly cold water extends to a 40-footradius around the shipwreck.
12. The floor is sporadically volcanically active, and underwater vents spew magma, gases and debris at random intervals and locations.
13. Several groups of four to six corpses, seemingly from teams of treasure hunters, make a trail to the wreck without reaching it. The bodies show no signs of injury, nor does any obvious danger present itself as the party approach the wreck.
14. Gigantic fissures line the sea floor. Occasionally, the floor rumbles, and one of the fissures extends ten to twenty feet closer to the wreck.
15. A sheer cliff climbs upward, but its plateau does not breach the water. Looking in the cliff's direction, the characters can see humanoid shapes launching from the plateau and diving along the cliff's face.
16. Nine calcified spires corkscrew up from the ground. They bend and twist in defiance of gravity and the flow of water as they reach toward the surface, none of them achieving the same height as any other. When viewed directly from above, they form a symbol signifying a powerful alien being.
17. A subsonic hum suffuses the area. Though virtually inaudible, it induces headaches and frays nerves for humanoids in a one-mile radius around the shipwreck.
18. A smack of jellyfish drifts above the wreck. When something disturbs the water within 100 feet of them, the jellyfish meander over to investigate.
19. A valley cuts through the ocean floor. The shipwreck rests 200 feet from the edge. Anyone inspecting the valley spies a serpentine path in the valley's centre. Bones dotted alongside the path suggest danger lurks in the valley.
20. Piles of rocks dot the area around the wreck. Investigating the rocks does not reveal whether they are natural formations or someone or something stacked them. Removing the rocks uncovers nothing but mud and silt. 





## MAJOR WRECK FEATURES 



1. Apart from the accumulation of barnacles on the hull, the ship is in pristine condition, and nothing indicates how it came to its watery grave.
2. The ship flipped upside down when it sunk, and the vessel has no hull damage, restricting easy access or observation of its interior.
3. The wreck teeters on the edge of an embankment, which overlooks a 100-foot drop to the seafloor below. Combat or other violent activity in the wreck threatens to nudge the ship over the edge.
4. The sand holding the ship has the consistency of quicksand. The ship has sunk deep enough so that only its deck and sails remain visible. The wreck has reached an equilibrium with the sand, but adding weight to the wreck—say the weight of a group of heavily armed adventurers—causes the ship to resume slowly sinking into the sand.
5. Split in two at the midsection, the ship's two halves rest 150 feet apart. The stern is partially sunk into the silt and sand covering the seabed while the prow stands proud atop an outcrop of rock.
6. Sharp barnacles encrust the ship's hull. However, the style of crew uniform and the condition of the materials found within indicate the wreck happened recently. The deep build-up of barnacles suggests the ship sank decades ago.
7. Two ships compose this wreck. One of the ships used a prow ram to sink the second ship, but the ram snagged on the other ship in the process. The mix of uniformed skeletons scattered about both wrecks shows the crews fought viciously as the boast sunk.
8. Kelp entwines itself around the wreck and through openings in the ship. Touching the kelp causes it to reflexively grab the person touching it.
9. The ship's hull has experienced rapid decay considering its limited time below the surface. Termites adapted to the water infest the wood, which someone notices with a close inspection or by destroying a plank. The termites may find their way into explorers' clothes, exposing the explorers' own vessel to danger.
10. Fire destroyed the ship's aft, causing it to sink. Tracing the fire to its source uncovers a splintered and charred barrel of alcohol, which someone may have intentionally set alight to sabotage the ship.
11. The bottom of the hull has been shattered. Bits of ice intermingle with fragments of wood. A close study indicates the wood was frozen solid from the inside out rather than the ship striking an iceberg before sinking.
12. Bent iron manacles, the chain to one of them ripped out of its mooring in the hull, seem meant for a titanic creature. A huge hole in the hull nearby shows where the creature bashed its way through the hull (which caused the ship to sink).
13. The ship's hull was pierced in three separate locations. A nearby coral spire tipped with three sharp prongs seems the likely culprit, but its tallest point lies several feet below the surface. Hours of observation reveal the spire shoots up to breach the surface at random intervals. Whether caused by seismic activity or some sinister mechanism is unclear from this vantage point.
14. In addition to carrying cargo, this ship was designed to transport passengers. Each door to a passenger's cabin is locked, ensuring the passenger(s) within drowned when the ship sank. The corpses of two crew, one of whom carries keys, lie in a heap outside a cabin door.
15. Slime coats every wooden surface on the ship, and it rapidly grows back when scraped away. The slime seems harmless to the touch. Though the slime seems responsible for the rapid rot of wood, causing the ship's inevitable sinking, its dissolving property becomes inert when submerged in water.
16. This oversized cargo ship dwarfs all other ships, including the mightiest war vessels. A letter proclaiming this the ship's maiden voyage and promising a glorious new age of seagoing exploration is affixed to the wall in the captain's quarters. A bloodstained handprint mars the letter.
17. A fierce storm sunk this ship. Each mast shows signs of taking a lightning strike, and the deck has indentations consistent with hail measuring at least eight inches in diameter. The ship's sails are shredded and lie draped over the wreck like a burial shroud.
18. Whoever commandeered this ship intended to make a hasty getaway, if the section of pier still tied to the ship is any indication. Based on the ship's name painted on the aft, the thieves sailed over 50 miles before the ship sank. Damage to the hull indicates catapult strikes from pursuers who clearly decided the better option was to destroy the ship rather than board and reclaim it.
19. The manifest reveals the wreck was a plague ship bound for an island where the victims could receive treatment away from civilisation to prevent further spread of the disease. Fires crippled the ship and led to its eventual demise. An investigation determines that someone deliberately sunk the ship. Investigators who spend much time among the diseased corpses of the ship's passengers may contract the disease, which remains contagious underwater.
20. Multitudes of fish and aquatic mammals battered this ship until they breached the hull and it sank. Explorers hear “thunking” sounds as fish still smash themselves against the wreck. Heaps of dazed and dead animals are piled up around the ship's exterior. What compels marine life to assault the ship remains a mystery. 





## MINOR WRECK FEATURES 



1. An octopus lairs within the ship after barely squeezing through the largest hole in the hull. The octopus contentedly eats fish swimming within reach of its tentacles. When presented with humanoid threats, it sprays ink and attempts to push through the hull to escape. Feeding fish to the octopus calms it.
2. The well-preserved corpse of a seabird is nailed face up on the deck. Fish avoid the bird. A character knowledgeable about birds and marine life identifies it as an albatross.
3. The ship's bowsprit figurehead is a decapitated mermaid. The top of the head is visible just above the sand 10 feet beyond the wreck.
4. A crew member's foot is lodged in a plank. The corpse still holds a mop, and the current gives the impression that the bloated corpse still swabs the deck.
5. Crabs scuttle through the wreck, feeding on the remains of the bodies buried at sea. The creatures raise their claws menacingly at intruders but amble away at aggressive posturing by those larger than themselves.
6. The ship's cannons are loaded and ready to fire. The water prevents most of them from discharging, but an improvising sort could devise a waterproof way to relight a cannon.
7. The ship's hold contains rotting bales of wheat and other foodstuffs. Investigating the ship's manifest reveals the food was to be delivered to a town wracked by famine.
8. Yowling emanates from a closet belowdecks. Upon opening the closet, which was sealed from the water, an unhappy cat struggles to swim in the water.
9. The bodies of press-ganged prisoners remain chained to their rowing stations, with some floating just above the boards upon which they sat. Notably, none of the voluntary crew seems to have gone down with the ship.
10. Stacks of lumber fill the cargo hold from floor to roof, leaving little room to manoeuvre. Eels reside in the lumber and aggressively defend their homes.
11. The ship bears sails belonging to one nation or region, but the hold contains sails belonging to an opposing nation or region. The ship sunk in waters controlled by the location matching the sails it currently displays but less than two miles from water contested by both states.
12. The captain's cabin is the scene of a mutiny. Several crew members and the captain have wounds consistent with the rapiers and sabres dropped to the floor nearby the bodies. It is unclear when the wreck occurred in relation to the mutiny.
13. Severed tentacles litter the ship's deck and cargo hold. The tentacles belong to various species of squid and octopodes, as well as other unidentifiable creatures. Each tentacle thrashes around when a warm-blooded creature moves within two feet of it.
14. Explorers discover navigational charts in the ship's wheelhouse. Anyone knowledgeable about geography or seafaring notices the charts are good for sea travel hundreds of leagues away from the wreck's location.
15. Large bells, suitable for a cathedral or clock tower, shifted in the hold when the ship went down. The pile of bells is unstable and crashes when carelessly disturbed or through nearby violent activity. The resultant wave carries sound a couple of hundred feet from the ship.
16. The captain's quarters contain a shrine dedicated to a deity associated with travel on land and sea. Though the rest of the quarters remain undisturbed apart from the ship sinking, someone has defaced the shrine. Whether this was done before, during or after the ship's sinking is impossible to say.
17. A grisly scene awaits those who explore belowdecks: the captain and several of the crew were hung from the top of the hold. Some of the bodies floated free of their nooses after the ship went down. Investigation of any of the free-floating corpses reveals signs of strangulation.
18. The ship has a pair of life rafts and several life preservers, but none of them saw any use because of the shipwreck. Searching the wreck discovers the remains of the captain and the full crew complement, who seem not to have sustained any wounds before the ship sank.
19. All the freshwater contained within barrels and waterskins is laced with a hallucinogenic drug. Searching the ship reveals several vials containing the drug's residue. Someone deliberately dosed the water once the ship has set sail.
20. A dozen cages, all intended to transport an animal or other creature no larger than a medium-sized dog, all hang open, but not through force. Though fur and feathers demonstrate the cages held cargo on part of the journey, there are no signs of their captives on or near the ship. 





## PIECES OF TREASURE 



1. A tarnished gold locket contains the image of a young woman. The locket bears the inscription, “To my darling. May this token bring you back to me. Forever, J.H.”
2. An oil painting of the married royal couple who commissioned the ship remains surprisingly wellpreserved after its time underwater.
3. Watertight bone tubes contain scrolls useful for controlling the waves and the weather. Each scroll displays a symbol associated with a sea deity. Someone knowledgeable about the deity, and discovering no shrine or other sign of deference to the deity, might reason the scrolls are cursed and brought about the ship's demise.
4. Five horizontally stacked coffins hide behind a secret panel in the hold. The coffins are watertight and appear filled with soil. If someone moves or digs into the soil in any coffin, they discover a preserved corpse wearing an ancient military uniform adorned with medals. The gold and silver medals have obvious worth, while a collector would pay a considerable sum for the uniform.
5. Concealed among barrels filled with hardtack, rendered useless by its exposure to seawater, a sealed oaken cask contains rare vintage brandy.
6. The ship was transporting numerous melee and ranged weapons, plus a couple of siege engines, meant to resupply one side of a war-torn region. While most of the ordinary weapons are standard quality, a pair of swords intended for high-ranking commanders have magical powers.
7. An ornate chandelier, weighing 40 pounds, magically provides light within the captain's quarters, even underwater. Among the artfully crafted crystals, a searcher finds five diamonds. Removing the diamonds ends the chandelier's magic, and the diamonds collectively fetch less than the entire chandelier.
8. The hold contains gold ingots from a variety of regions. Each ingot is stamped with a symbol denoting the region from which it was taken, presumably by the ship's crew. Returning the gold nets a paltry reward relative to its value, but attempting to sell the ingots outside of back-alley deals proves difficult.
9. The crew pulled in a bounty of oysters, many of which are still edible. More importantly, someone spending an hour searching through the oysters has a cumulative 10% chance of finding a pearl. (This chance resets once a character has found a pearl).
10. While not itself a treasure, this map shows the location of a buried treasure on a remote island. Assuming the ship's bearing is true to the wreck's current location, the vessel was travelling toward the island when it sunk.
11. The ship's ram ends in a gold head, with bronze plating concealing its true value.
12. The ship's captain insisted on luxuries where they were available, which included dining. A full silverware set, somewhat tarnished by its exposure to saltwater, and a full table setting of finely crafted plates, cups, bowls and tureens are locked within a mahogany cabinet.
13. A pair of worn and obviously old vaguely human-shaped jade statuettes perch atop a toppled crate. The statuettes remain damp after removal from the water.
14. One of the crew was an accomplished musician and brought a prized violin on the journey. Oiled cloths protect and conceal the violin, for which another violinist would pay a considerable sum.
15. The ship's navigator possessed a bronze astrolabe, magically enhanced to locate its guiding star even under overcast skies.
16. A clever crew member stashed a bag of gold coins in a conveniently concealed hollow space in the cargo hold's wall. Those responsible for sinking and ransacking the ship had no time to find the coins.
17. The crew collected venom from sea anemones and stored it in vials. A thieves' guild or an assassin would pay generously for the poison.
18. A pair of brass lions, intended as an offering as part of a nascent treaty between two warring nations, landed next to the ship. Bringing the statues, which weigh 150 pounds apiece, to either nation earns a substantial reward from the ruler who sent the lions.
19. Nets contain 500 pounds of fish, notable for their smoky flavour and glands which produce a narcotic effect when properly prepared.
20. Among ancient brass coins recovered from another shipwreck, explorers discover lumps of grey metal which grant unusual properties to armour and weapons forged with it. Perhaps the brass coins are cursed—and the cause of this ship's doom. 





## GHOSTLY HAUNTINGS 



1. MIELIKKI TOIVAS Detecting Mielikki's Presence: A nearby clam, larger than a human, closes its shell, as a shadow cast by a shark swimming overhead passes over the shell. The shark is nowhere to be found. Attired in a workaday sailor's outfit, this raven-haired woman grips a blood-covered cutlass. Mielikki Toivas (CG female human ghost [in life, thief 2]) quakes. When Mielikki Toivas's ship went down, nearby sharks attacked the crew. She escaped the initial attack and spent her last days floating on lashed-together planks and awaiting rescue. Two days in, one of the sharks began to circle her, driving her mad with terror before it killed her. Personality: When Mielikki is not fearful of a shark attack, she greets visitors as if she were a couple of drinks in at the tavern. She describes the ship in detail, helping explorers find hidden items they may have missed. Mannerisms: Mielikki moves no more than five feet from the safety of her giant clamshell. Even at her most boisterous, she flicks glances at the sea above. Seeing something no one else can, she dives into the clamshell and uses telekinesis to close the halves around her, without regard to trapping anyone else within. Rest in Peace: If someone kills the shark that ate Mielikki, retrieves her bones from its belly and gives them a proper burial, the sailor passes on to her eternal rest. As a token of her gratitude, she grants the shark's killer with a minor boon in future encounters with sharks.
2. UOTI KUNINGAS Detecting Uoti's Presence: Loud snoring impossibly travels through the watery depths before someone startles and then curses. Moments after the cursing, a green spotlight shines on the wreck and then winks out, momentarily shrouding the area in darkness. This thin, greying man personifies unkempt: his hair hasn't seen a comb for days, his face hasn't seen a razor for longer and stains and holes riddle his clothes. Uoti Kuningas (NE male human ghost [in life, fighter 1]) glowers. Lighthouse keeper Uoti Kuningas fell asleep on duty and failed to notice the extinguishment of the fire lighting the beacon, which was also due to his negligence. The beacon's absence caused a ship to run aground and sink, killing everyone on board. The captain uttered a death curse upon Uoti, who suddenly died of a heart attack and whose spirit became tied to the ship his negligence wrecked. Personality: Uoti was a taciturn man who enjoyed his solitude, and the years spent haunting the results of his neglect have done nothing to improve his disposition. He delights in frightening explorers away from “his” ship. Mannerisms: The former lighthouse keeper wanders the wreck, shouting about the disaster not being his fault before he shouts devolve into incoherent ranting. When he notices intruders, he hides behind or within solid objects and waits for an opportunity to surprise them. Rest in Peace: The first step to releasing Uoti's spirit requires him to atone for his mistakes. Afterwards, the ghostly lighthouse keeper must warn a ship's captain about the treacherous waters which sunk the ship he haunts. 





# TORTURE CHAMBERS 



## NOTABLE FEATURES 



1. The chamber is dark; only the flickering illumination provided by several candles and a smouldering brazier provide any light.
2. The foul stench of blood, excrement, vomit and fear hang in the air like a veritable miasma.
3. Old, dirty straw and sawdust—to soak up blood and other liquid—cover the floor. The room stinks.
4. A short flight of stairs lead down into the chamber which has a double-height ceiling. Several hooks hang from the ceiling; from one hangs a small cage barely large enough to hold a hunched man.
5. A ten-foot-long rack dominates the chamber. All manner of unspeakable things stain its surface.
6. An iron maiden—cast in the likeness of a beautiful, smiling woman—stands on a low bloodstained pedestal.
7. Deep recesses, complete with manacles driven into the stone, pierce the wall. Each holiday has a good view of the chamber; here are chained those whose torture begins with watching their fellows suffer.
8. Rats dwell in a network of small fissures piercing the walls. They have learnt to venture forth once the screaming has stopped to feast on the victims' leavings.
9. A deep, rat-infested oubliette pierces the chamber's floor; a wooden ladder lies nearby.
10. Much of the floor comprises iron bars that separate the chamber from the dank cells below. Skeletal remains in the cells glimmer in the flickering light and several prisoners may cower in the cells' farthest recesses.
11. An iron, vaguely man-shaped, cage hangs from the ceiling. Roll on “Prisoners” to determine who languishes within the cage.
12. The bloody, broken and burnt body of a naked man lies against one wall. The man is dead and has obviously been extensively tortured. Examination reveals one of his eyes has been burnt out and that he has been gelded. 

## DRESSINGS 



1. The room's walls are slick with water oozing through cracks in the stone. It is cold in the torture chamber.
2. A pile of wood and sacks of coal—fuel for the chamber's fires—stand against one wall.
3. A bucket of dirty water and a filthy scrap of cloth stand next to one of the instruments of torture.
4. A small, filthy cage holds six half-starved, feral rats. Sometimes, the torturer feeds them “offcuts” from his yet-living victims.
5. Several gently swaying chains hang from the ceiling to a height about five-foot above the floor. Nearby, winches enable the chains to be raised and lowered.
6. Several candles provide dim pockets of illumination; each is placed to illuminate one of the chamber's devices.
7. A row of small hooks jut from the wall nearest the chamber's door; black hoods and dirty, scorched leather aprons hang from the hooks.
8. A pool of congealed blood lies near a notable instrument of torture. A half-hearted attempt has been made to dry up the pool with a small pile of sawdust.
9. Chains hanging from the ceiling jangle softly in the grip of a slight breeze issuing from some unknown place.
10. Rank bloodstained straw mixed with sawdust covers the floor around the chamber's notable torture devices.
11. A wooden bin standing against one wall holds a sodden, filthy mass of bloody clothes torn from the torturers' last score of victims.
12. Deep shadows, pregnant with malice, cluster in the room's corners and recesses. It is as if all the suffering and pain wrought in this room yet lingers on after the victims themselves have died.
13. Dim light from several guttering torches provides flickering illumination in the chamber's recesses. A shuttered lantern hangs from the ceiling and emits a faint radiance over the room's notable instruments of torture.
14. The torturer's next victim is manacled to one wall. (Refer to “Prisoners” to determine who the characters encounter here). Clearly in pain, the prisoner begs to be rescued. Badly injured, they'll need magical healing to be able to escape the dungeon (unless the characters carry them).
15. A large book stands on a side table next to a quill and ink pot. Herein is written the information extracted from those put to the question. Most pages feature a scrawled, virtually illegible signature, at the bottom.
16. A cage hanging from the ceiling in one corner of the room holds a mass of broken, discoloured bones.
17. Bloody rags and a suspiciously red, partially congealed liquid, fill a rusting bucket standing by the chamber door.
18. Incongruously amid the gore and instruments of torture, a platter of food stands atop a small table along with a flagon of wine and a pewter cup.
19. A smear of dried blood leads from a large instrument of torture across the floor to the room's door. (Or alternatively, the smear could lead toward a small cell in which sprawls the torturer's current victim.)
20. A long series of scratches mar one wall. The scratches are a rough count of the victims put to the question in the chamber. If the characters question the torturer he proudly reveals what the scratches represent and can even put a name to several of the more prominent marks. 





## NOTABLE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE 



1. Oversized and cast to appear like a hideous devil or demon, this iron maiden is a favourite of the torturers. The spikes within are not long enough to pierce vital internal organs.
2. Squat, and obviously stoutly made, this long rack features a winch at one end and manacles to secure the prisoner. Dried vomit covers one end of the device.
3. A thick-bodied cast iron cauldron stands on a metal tripod over a smouldering fire pit. A horrible mix of water and tar bubbles away, within the cauldron.
4. Small, blood-stained sharp spikes cover the armrests and seat of this metal chair; locking manacles festoon the chair's armrests and legs.
5. An oversized and bloodstained cartwheel replete with sturdy straps hangs from an A-frame. A small fire pit below the wheel yet smoulders.
6. A large cauldron atop a metal frame stands over a fire pit stacked with oil-soaked wood and coal. 

## LESSER INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE 



1. Thumbscrews of brass and wood rest on a table among various knives and other tools of the torturer's trade.
2. A smouldering cast iron brazier holds several branding irons thrust deeply into the coals half-filling the brazier. Strips of dirty cloth are wrapped around each branding iron's handle.
3. Wisps of burnt, blackened flesh cling to a dented metal bucket's rim.
4. Thick-nosed pliers hang from a hook on one wall amid an array of knives and other tools of the trade.
5. A long carpenter's saw, dried blood and gore clinging to its jagged teeth, hangs from a wooden peg driven deeply into a wall.
6. A blood-soaked cat o' nine tails hangs from the wall.
7. A set of curved knives of various sizes fills a soft leather pouch. Compared to the other implements of torture they are surprisingly clean.
8. The haft of a hand hammer protrudes from a bin of tools. 





## TORTURERS 



1. BAGGI Fat and filthy this muscular orc woman wears a dirty, bloodstained shift. Her black eyes glitter with fell intent. Baggi (NE female orc fighter 3) loves her job and delights in the screaming she elicits from her victims. She loves her victim's frenzied pleas for mercy even more. Personality: Merciless and driven to odd levels of excitement by other people's pain and suffering, Baggi has no friends and rarely emerges from her dismal lair. Cunning— for a bloodthirsty orc—she is good at discovering her victim's deepest fears…and then fulfilling them. Mannerisms: Baggi licks her lips and snorts with excitement while working on a victim. Sometimes, she licks fresh blood from her victim's quivering, pain-wracked flesh. Hook: If accosted in her lair, Baggi uses a red-hot poker in battle. She has a small cache of treasure hidden in her chamber and offers it in exchange for her life if a fight goes against her. She marks any enemies defeating her for later revenge and could become a reoccurring villain.
2. BARKAL Covered in coarse brown fur this tall humanoid has milk-white glittering eyes and a look of feral glee on its face. Barkal (CE female bugbear) lives to inflict pain on those in her sinister grasp. She favours near death by strangulation as well as the slow, methodical breaking of her subject's bones in her quest for knowledge, confession or punishment. Personality: Feral, sadistic and enthusiastic to the point of mania in her role as torturer sometimes Barkal gets carried away and her victims die before they can confess. When this happens, Barkal eats well. She particularly enjoys snacking on a still-living prisoner's recently removed fingers, toes or ears—preferably, while they watch. Mannerisms: Barkal licks her lips at the thought of an upcoming torture session. When she's actually torturing someone, drool runs down her chin and she emits unwholesome grunts and moans of excitement. Hook: Barkal is particularly proud of her necklace of human ears; she rarely takes it off. If anything should happen to her beloved trinket, she flies into a berserk rage.
3. KUSTAA AMPUJA Skinny, and wearing little more than a breechcloth, this blackhaired man moves with economical grace. Kustaa Ampuja (LE middle-aged male human thief 2) holds no particular grudge against those he must put to the question but much prefers to be the one asking the questions than the one answering them. When he was younger, Kustaa was a notorious thief who fell foul of the law, after a particularly brutal murder. He was given a choice: death by boiling or serving as a torturer. He chose the latter. Personality: Kustaa doesn't particularly enjoy his job, but believes in an interrogation well done. He leaves no stone unturned—or no finger unbroken—in his search for the truth. Mannerisms: Kustaa is slowly slipping into madness; all the pain and suffering inflicted by his hand has slightly unhinged his sanity. Thus, he constantly mutters to himself (or perhaps to an invisible confidant). Hook: Kustaa throws himself on the characters' mercy if all seems lost and relates the whole sorry tale of how he became a torturer. He expects sympathy and mercy—after all, what choice did he have? It was either become a torturer or suffer a horrendous, drawn-out death.
4. OLAVI AIKIO Wearing clean robes of startlingly fashionable cut this wiry old man carries a large, curved knife at his hip. Although he is clearly aged, his eyes shine with intelligence and his thews yet seem strong. Olavi Aikio (N old male human fighter 4) prefers to not resort to the crude, traditional methods of torture much beloved by his more normal contemporaries. Although old, Olavi remains strong and his mind remains clear. Olavi has seen much in his long life; when he grew too old to continue serving his lord as a soldier he volunteered to become a torturer; thus, he feels he is still useful and his life has a purpose. Personality: In Olavi's mind, if you end up in his “care”, you've probably done something to deserve it. His charge's suffering is nothing to him; he could care less one way or the other. However, he has a fanatical belief in the beauty and strength of the truth. Olavi brooks no lying, and would much prefer a civilised conversation over the blood, gore and endless screaming of “normal” interrogations. Mannerisms: Olavi smiles sadly and sighs deeply when he believes someone is lying to him. Prisoners get one chance to change their story before Olavi resorts to more “traditional” methods of questioning. Hook: Olavi is well aware of how adventurers intruding in his lair will likely feel about torturers. While he is prepared to sell his life dearly, any prisoners present may speak up in his defence—probably surprising the characters. 





## MAJOR PRISON CELL FEATURES 



1. The cell is sunken below the level of the corridor outside. A flight of narrow steps leads down into the cell. In places, water oozes through cracks in the walls low down near the floor.
2. Sets of manacles high up on one wall lead to short lengths of rusting chains set deep into the stone. The manacles are set at such a height as to keep a prisoner's arms above their head.
3. Deliberately designed with a low ceiling, humans and the like cannot stand upright in this cell.
4. A length of chain hangs from the ceiling; driven into the ceiling with a gigantic iron spike it reaches down to about seven-foot above the floor. Bloody manacles hang from the chain.
5. As #4 but several chains hang from the ceiling—one in each corner of the cell.
6. A small drain barely two-foot square pierces the floor in the lowest part of this dank cell. A rusty iron grate blocks the hole; perceptive characters notice the mortar holding the grate in place is crumbling away in places.
7. A skeleton lies against a wall amid rotting straw and mouldering clothes. The skeleton is of a human male, and perceptive characters notice the man is missing a leg bone. Searching the straw reveals the sharpened bone has been transformed into a crude, but sharp, dagger.
8. This cell is partially underwater; a pool of dirty, muddy water covers most of the floor—only a small raised area by the door remains dry. 

## PRISON CELL DRESSING 



1. Mouldering straw covers the floor of this cell; the smell of rot mixes with that of urine, excrement and fear.
2. Marks on the back of the cell door show where a previous occupant has scratched pitifully at the wood.
3. A splatter of dried blood decorates one wall.
4. Graffiti—cursing the lord of the dungeon—hidden under a pile of mouldering straw decorates one section of floor. A sharpened bone lies among the straw.
5. A bucket, reeking of excrement and urine, stands in one corner of the cell. The cell stinks.
6. Perceptive characters notice a loose brick or chunk of stone in one wall; removing the stone reveals a small secret niche in which someone has hidden a gold ring. Dust and grime cover the ring, suggesting it has lain here for many years.
7. The name “Johann” is shakily daubed in dried blood on one wall.
8. A small crack in one wall intersects with the next room, enabling the cell's occupants to hear what is going on there, and perhaps communicate with the other room's similarly doomed inhabitants.
9. Five small holes in one wall against the floor lead to a small rats' nest; the rats' excrement dots the floor before the entrances.
10. Dirty straw covers the floor; perceptive characters discover several gnawed rat corpses hidden within. 





## PRISONERS 



1. ANTERO KULTAMIES Clad in ripped and torn leather armour, this man has been savagely beaten—his face is a mass of bruises and cuts. Antero Kultamies (CG male human ranger 2) made the fatal mistake of getting too close to whom he was employed to spy upon. Caught and beaten he languishes here until he reveals his employer's name. Thus far, Antero has resisted the preliminaries, but gloom fills his heart for he fears no rescuers are coming for him—the characters' arrival gives him fresh hope and energy. Personality: Taciturn and brave Antero has managed to remain quiet. However, the pain of his various injuries is fast becoming too much for him to bear. He knows he will soon break and believes his death will soon follow. Like a cornered wild thing, he waits for his chance to attempt a final break for freedom or to die fighting his captors. Mannerisms: Antero involuntarily flexes his muscles and clenches his hands into fists when frightened, angry or stressed. He does this a lot. Hook: Antero prefers a quick death to the drawn-out misery of further torture. In combat, he is frenzied and without fear—particularly if the torturer is within his grasp.
2. NAK Wearing dirty, soiled clothes this small goblinoid creature sits huddled in a corner sobbing to itself. Nak (NE female goblin) lusted after the dungeon's shiny treasures and couldn't stop herself filching several when the opportunity arose. Caught redhanded, she expects no mercy from the torturer who suspects she was not working alone. Nak only speaks Goblin. Personality: Nak is terrified; she's heard horrible tales about what happens in the torture chamber and will do anything to avoid her fate. She is, however, stupid and little more than a feral scavenger. She's not clever enough to escape on her own. Mannerisms: Sobbing uncontrollably, Nak's speech is virtually unintelligible. If she can be coaxed into conversation she uses only short, simple words. Hook: Nak will say or do anything to escape back to her fellows (who will be in trouble because they have not tried to rescue her). She is impulsive and makes a break for freedom at the first opportunity—even if it's a terrible opportunity.
3. PIETI MEURAKAS This tall and muscular warrior wears shredded and torn clothes. Small burn marks mar his forearms and a horrible mass of burnt skin covers the left-hand side of his neck. Pieti Meurakas (CE male human fighter 1) served as a guard in the dungeon until he fell asleep while on guard. It so happened his lapse of concentration coincided with a theft, and suspicion has fallen on Pieti as an accomplice to the thieves in question. Pieti knows his fate if he confesses and he's resolved to hold out as long as possible. Personality: Lazy and self-serving, Pieti nevertheless has great potential as a warrior—if he could find a cause he believes insufficiently. Pieti believes he is destined for greatness and his current low station is only temporary. Mannerisms: Pieti picks his nose, when he doesn't think anyone is watching. Hook: Pieti isn't an idiot; he suspects the truth will not ingratiate him with potential rescuers. Rather, he lies telling the characters he is the only survivor of a mercenary caravan, but perceptive characters may notice certain inconsistencies in this story. If escorted from the dungeon, he loots as much equipment and treasure as possible before fleeing.
4. RASAL TURLE Dirt and bruises cover this gnome's once cheery face. She wears ripped clothing and a torn, grey-hued cloak pulled tight around her slight form. Her hair is a startlingly deep blue in colour. Rasal Turle (CG female gnome illusionist 4) believes she is the only survivor of an adventuring party that dared this dungeon a week before the characters began their forays. The Company of the Cloaked Creepers were a six-strong group plagued by poor planning and impetuous decision making; their luck finally ran out. Personality: Devastated at her friends' deaths, Rasal remains unbowed and unbroken. She plots her revenge against the dungeon's denizens and has recently discovered she has a great capacity for hatred and revenge. This worries her—the depth and strength of such negative emotions are new to her. Mannerisms: Dried blood clogs Rasal's broken nose. She is having difficulty breathing and every now and then blows her nose hard to try and dislodge the various clots and blockages within. (Her nose needs to be reset, but Rasal is scared of the pain such a treatment would inevitably inflict.) Hook: Rasal wants to retrieve her friends' remains and to give them a decent burial far away from this evil place. She is clearly incapable of doing this without help (even assuming the remains in question can be located). She is also desperate to retrieve her spellbook, and begs for the party's help in this also. 





# TOWNSFOLK & VILLAGERS 







## BEGGARS & VAGABONDS 



1. Kaarlo Hirvonen (N male human): Emaciated and wearing oversized ragged clothes Kaarlo is a pathetic sight. With unkempt curly brown hair and a mouth full of rotting teeth and bleeding gums, he seems on the edge of physical collapse. Desperate to get off the streets, Kaalo will do anything short of murder to improve his lot.
2. Uljas Aalto (CN old male human): Painfully thin, and with a perpetual look of bemused confusion on his face, Uljas often seems in a world of his own. Scraggly dirty blond hair barely covers his scalp and “interesting” skin lesions cover his right forearm. With a lifetime of living on the streets behind him, Uljas is wary of authority figures, strangers and those that seem too friendly.
3. Helmi Laitnen (N female human): New in town, Helmi is still looking for somewhere to call home. Driven forth from a nearby settlement after her arrival heralded an outbreak of plague, Helmi is bitter and angry. (Helmi is a carrier for a virulent form of plague, but is immune to the disease herself). Clad in voluminous, travel-stained robes, her sex is not immediately apparent, but the signs of ill-health—a grey parlour to her skin and lank, greasy hair are obvious.
4. Jorma Ukkola (NE male human): Once a servant to an affluent family, Jorma was cast out onto the streets after being accused of thievery. He is desperate for two things —revenge on the family who destroyed his reputation and livelihood and for a return to gainful employment. He latches onto one of the characters and does all he can to ingratiate himself. Fastidious in his appearance, Jorma is as clean and tidy as his circumstances allow. Almost six and a half feet tall, he walks with a stoop.
5. Jani Hujanen (LN old male human fighter 2): An exsoldier, Jani was crippled in a borderland skirmish long ago. Now aged, this one-legged soldier cuts a dejected figure as he slowly hops through the streets with his makeshift crutch. Fiercely proud, but all too aware of his failing health, Jani is a leader of sorts among the street brethren. His grey eyes still sparkle with determination and his voice remains firm. Strength yet lurks within his frame, but he knows his time draws near.
6. Ossi Auvienen (CN male human): Short and cursed with a speech impediment, Ossi is a lonely figure. He thus speaks little, but hears much. Never without his “backpack of holding” Ossi is often seen scavenging for food scraps and things to sell to the town's various pawnbrokers and curio shops. He rarely gets a reasonable price. Ossi has known little but misery and struggle through his life and is resigned to his fate.
7. Outi Eerola (CN middle-aged female human): Mad—and a little dangerous as a result—Outi wears the ragged remnants of many skirts and dresses patched together into her pride and joy—a voluminous dress of many layers. With terrible breath and few social graces, Outi is unpopular except among those who hear wisdom in her deranged ramblings. In middle-age, Outi is old beyond her years and already her hands suffer from terrible arthritis that has turned them into virtual claws.
8. Veli (NE male human): Horribly disfigured by a childhood illness Veli was cast into the streets by his family when they realised they could no longer afford his care. Bitter and resentful, he is in near-constant pain. With a shock of matted red hair and a disfigured, almost melted, face, Veli is hard to miss. He wears a cowled cloak and keeps to the shadows and alleyways. Anyone using powerful magic to heal him gains a life-long, devoted servant. (A servant who nonetheless plots revenge against his family for their betrayal).
9. Ulpa Rekunen (N female human): Thrown out by her husband when he discovered she had fallen pregnant by another man, guilt and grief dominate Ulpa's life. Homeless, and alone, she could not care for her newborn baby who died a few weeks after its birth. Now despondent and without hope, Ulpa drifts through life waiting to die. Once attractive, grief and living on the streets have aged her beyond her years.
10. Taneli Itkonen (N young male human magic-user 1): Not even ten years old, Taneli does not remember a time when he didn't live on the street. He has no memory of his parents and was brought up by Jani Hujanen (see #5 above). Good with animals, a pack of small dogs, trained to do certain rudimentary tricks, often accompany him as he begs for food or coin. He does not know it, but a spark of greatness lurks within him; his mother was a powerful sorceress who fell in battle against a terrible demon and he has inherited some of her powers— powers which are starting to manifest themselves… 





## GUARDS & SOLDIERS 



1. Onni Keto (NE male human fighter 1): Corrupt and despicable, Onni uses his position to exact bribes and fines from vulnerable people crossing his path. Often unshaven and generally unkempt he looks more like a local tough than a soldier. Disliked by many of his fellows, he is suspected of having links with certain unsavoury locals. Such rumours are false—Onni is only out for himself.
2. Panu Korpela (LN male human fighter 1): Burly and a little dim, Panu is a dependable but unimaginative warrior. When confused by a situation he follows local laws to the letter. He takes great solace in the rule of law as he doesn't have to use his own initiative in confusing situations. For all that, he is a friendly man and does not hold grudges.
3. Elina Alanen (LN female human fighter 3): A highly competent warrior, Elina sometimes despairs of her companions. A veteran of many border skirmishes and the like, she has seen real action—not like those she now trains. Her superiors have marked her for promotion.
4. Hannu Purho (N middle-aged male human fighter 2): Injured in the line of duty, Hannu walks with a distinctive limp and sometimes falls behind his fellows when out on patrol. He hates being a liability and is an excellent warrior in every other way. For all that, he now dreams of retirement—perhaps to a training post where he can pass on his skills. Hannu is particularly skilled with the shield and is developing his own unique fighting style in his leisure time. He is as bald as an egg.
5. Mira Rekunen (NG female human fighter 1): Mira has only just become a soldier; her family has fallen on hard times, and she needed the steady wage to keep her aged parents off the streets. She doesn't particularly enjoy a soldier's life and is making the best of a bad job. She appears ill at ease in her armour and has not actually yet seen action—if a fight breaks out she joins in only hesitantly. A jagged scar on her cheek is the result of a training accident (and makes her look harder than she actually is).
6. Vuokko Ukkola (NG female human fighter 2): Tall for a woman, Vuokka towers over most of her male comrades. As muscular as she is remarkably tall, Vuokka is an imposing sight. Once a blacksmith by trade, the lust for action burned deep within her and she became a soldier. Faded and healed scars—results of her blacksmithing—mar her forearms. She has a deep, strident voice and is a terror in battle.
7. Urmas Ojanen (LN middle-aged male human fighter 1): Short and stocky, Urmas is a career soldier. He has known no other life and would be utterly lost without the order and discipline of military life. Urmas is also a borderline alcoholic—his face is blotchy and his eyes ringed by deep bags—which is beginning to interfere with his duties. He is always licking his lips—as if thirsty— and is never without a small flask about his person.
8. Jarmo Sianio (CG male human fighter 3): Big, burly and fearless Jarmo is a soldier's soldier. Scion of a distant land, he escaped a slaver's coffle and after a series of adventures found himself a soldier. He is biding his time until he has amassed enough pay to attempt to get home and will desert when the time is right. His pale blue eyes, fair hair and parchment-white skin mark him out as an outsider. He also speaks with a comically thick foreign accent.
9. Mikko Leino (N male human fighter 1): Mikko has a very strange sense of humour (he believes he is too intelligent for his companions) and often makes inappropriate jokes (which can lead to brawls and suchlike). Still—for all that—he is a decent person; he genuinely doesn't understand why people don't find him funny. Mikko has a strange growth—an abnormally large mole—on his neck about which he is self-conscious. He keeps his black hair long to hide his mole and is fastidious about his appearance.
10. Terttu Paananen (LE female human fighter 1/thief 1): Terttu is a spy for a rival lord or organisation. She is a consummate actor and has ingratiated herself with her fellows. She is friendly, perhaps overly so, and takes the time to get to know the characters—they might be helpful to her in the future. Her hair is dyed black, but perceptive characters may notice her blond roots coming through. 





## MERCHANTS & TRADERS 



1. Elena Itkonen (NE old female human): This old woman has a full head of carefully styled silvery hair and carries herself with dignity. A snob, she believes she is above many of the people she encounters on a daily basis and is—consequently—distant, but polite. Her husband has recently died and she is desperately lonely.
2. Kaari Rantanen (NG female human): Clad in a loose black dress, this slender, brown-hair woman attracts much male attention. She is friendly, and loves dogs—but hates cats and the like.
3. Usko Karppanen (LN old male human): This old, but fit, man with a splotchy purple birthmark on his face harbours dreams of youth and battles against old age's insidious advance. He wears tight-fitting clothes and is evidently prosperous given their cut and quality. He has dreams of the adventuring life—but that is all they are; if given the opportunity to engage in an actual adventure he demurs (politely).
4. Onni Keto (CN middle-aged male human): Middle-aged and podgy, Onni, has two young daughters and several failed marriages. Despite this, he is cheerful, if a little over-friendly. It doesn't take long for him to try selling the characters something. He has tightly cropped dirty brown hair and a beard. His good-humour is a cover for the aching loneliness filling his heart. He is also a frustrated painter and dreams of someday securing a wealthy patron.
5. Jaska Outila (LN male human): Believing himself to be an accomplished trader with an extensive network of suppliers and customers in the locality Jaska prides himself on his ability to get on with anyone. In truth, Jaska is popular because he is easy to haggle down— something he is beginning to realise. Slender with dark hair and green eyes he is always impeccably dressed.
6. Pia Purho (N female human): Just starting out on her own, Pia aggressively courts as a customer anyone who seems to have coin. Although she is skilled at selling, her accounting and bookkeeping skills are weak, and she is losing money as a result. Wildly—perhaps irritatingly cheerful—she does not take no for an answer.
7. Ulpa Tuomi (CE female human): Utterly without morals or scruples, Ulpa is a psychopath. She cares for no one but herself and happily sells any old crap to her customers (assuming she won't get caught). She pretends to work for a patron who lives in a distant city and directs any complaints to him. Ulpa is often on the move—to keep ahead of irate customers. She has luscious black hair and black piercing eyes and dresses in fine, if a little risqué, clothes.
8. Valto Rintala (LN middle-aged male human): Short and dumpy, Valto enjoys the good life. A prosperous merchant, he now leads a small staff who do much of the actual work. Valto has grown lazy—and a little fat—and has forgotten what a proper day's work feels like. Often found meeting clients for drinks or a meal, he is frequently encountered wearing slightly soiled clothes.
9. Virpi Markku (LN female human): Inflexible and obsessed with perfection, Virpi, is not easy to get on with. For Virpi, the price is the price—haggling with her is pointless, and her wares' quality is beyond reproach. She is tall but developing a middle-age spread which she artfully conceals with fine, loose-fitting robes.
10. Usko Laitnen (LG old male human): Usko has a big heart and spends most of his profits on feeding the poor, helping orphans find new homes and so on. He would be wealthy if he did not spend his money so, something several of his own grown-up children resent immensely. He is popular in the locality and is not short of friends. He is suspicious of newcomers, though, for he has been swindled several times in the last few years. He walks with a cane and never without a hat—he went bald twenty years ago and is extremely self-conscious about his lack of hair. 





## PEASANTS & SERFS 



1. Pekka Leino (LN male human): New in town, Pekka needs work as his funds will only keep him off the streets for a few more weeks. Pekka's home village was recently devastated by a terrible plague, and he fled after his family fell into its ebon embrace. Skilled in general labouring, Pekka owns little but the clothes on his back and the few items in his pack. He is brawny, hardworking and unimaginative.
2. Ilari Korpela (NG middle-aged human male): Fat, unfit and a little bit arthritic Ilari has short red hair and fair skin. He wears well-maintained, but old clothes. He hobbles about town in search of odd jobs. He is better educated than many of his fellows and craves a job that enables him to sit down and stay inside as much as possible. He has dreams of becoming a famous bard, but his singing voice is average at best.
3. Vesa Laitnen (N old human male): With a decent head of white hair, Vesa is the quintessential old man. He has nowhere to go and all day to get there. Consequently, he is chatty and friendly. He has a vast store of local knowledge and knows much of what goes on in the locality. Sadly, most of his knowledge is limited to the usual, banal goings-on of life and is of little interest to adventurers intent on gold and glory.
4. Aune Eronen (LN female human): This burly woman has short-cropped brown hair and wears a look of studied boredom on her face. A beautiful wolfhound lopes alongside her. The dog is fiercely protective of its mistress and can go from a placid hound to a snarling war dog in the blink of an eye.
5. Asta Auvienen (CN old female human): This stick-thin old woman wears a droopy red and blue hat that almost obscures her face completely. She is inquisitive and chatty and carrying a basket that is obviously too heavy for her to manage easily.
6. Arvo Eskola (CN young male human): Still clinging to his teenage years, Arvo is cheerful, gregarious and chronically unorganised. He wears his shoulder-length brown hair—his pride and joy—pulled back in a ponytail. He is always in a rush and often breathless and a little confused. Perpetually surrounded by an aura of chaos he is rarely in one place long. His parents despair of him.
7. Onni Ojanen (CN old male human): Growing old, but still vigorous, Onni has a finely maintained silvering goatee and is a popular, friendly man. His hair is similarly greying and deep bags under his eyes hint at many late nights. Knowledgeable about many things, he believes he is knowledgeable about a great many other things as well. He is not shy about sharing his knowledge.
8. Raimo Leino (CE male human): The victim of a horrible accident, when a cart crushed his right arm, Raimo has struggled with depression ever since. His skin is sallow and deep bags hang under his eyes. He nightly relives the accident that took his arm and often wakes up screaming. With but one arm and scraggly dark-brown hair Raimo cuts a distinctive figure. Not above lying to gain an advantage, he tells newcomers of his heroic service in the local lord's soldiery in the hopes of snagging a payout—or at least a meal—from a gullible, wealthy adventurer.
9. Mira Outila (LG female human): Mira is popular and well-liked. She has a reputation for caring and has some small skill as an apothecary, which she shares with her neighbours without thought of payment. Slender, with short brown hair, pale skin and deep blue eyes she stands out from her neighbours and friends. Tortured by thoughts of those she was not able to save with her skills, she sometimes disappears for days at a time on herbcollecting expeditions.
10. Kaari Keto (CG female human): Friendly, but often surrounded by drama and stress, Kaari is never happier than when in the company of friends. A frustrated social climber she greatly desires to better her family's lot through her connections with the well-to-do. She has had some minor success in this and—consequently— dress slightly more ostentatiously than a typical peasant. She is overly friendly and has many male friends—who sometimes misinterpret her friendliness—and an increasingly frustrated husband. 





## ENCOUNTER HOOKS 



1. The NPC is rushing for an “important meeting” and tries to get away from the characters as quickly as possible.
2. The NPC is having a bad day and is in a bad mood.
3. The NPC has just been mugged or otherwise attacked. Bruised and bloodied, they are a little disorientated.
4. The NPC is engaged in an argument with someone else. For some reason, they decide the characters are the perfect people to decide who is right and who is wrong.
5. The NPC has a child (or perhaps a friend) obsessed with the adventuring lifestyle and thinking of giving up their normal and safe—boring—life to go adventuring. The NPC wants the characters to talk them out of it.
6. The NPC staggers along, carrying a heavy bundle, box or another burden. They are grateful for the characters' assistance and, in return, shares a current rumour. If the characters are particularly helpful, the NPC invites them into their place of business or home for refreshments.
7. The NPC thinks they are being chased or hunted by someone. They stumble into the characters and asks for their protection. No pursuer is immediately apparent.
8. The NPC is wandering along with nothing to do for the rest of the day. They idly engage the characters in conversation if an opportunity presents itself.
9. The NPC has just been pickpocketed (or perhaps merely has lost their money pouch) and is causing a commotion.
10. The NPC is going to or returning from a shop or market.
11. The NPC is going to meet a friend for a drink and is in a good mood.
12. T h e N P C i s recovering from a recent leg injury and l i m p i n g a l o n g (perhaps using a cane stick).
13. The NPC is a little worse for wear. They could be merely tired after working late into the night or recovering from a drinking session. Whatever the cause, they look weary and could be a bit snappy.
14. The NPC is distracted by something—perhaps they are in love or has suffered a “direct hit” from a bird flying overhead—and bumps into a character. They apologise.
15. The NPC is wearing inappropriate clothing for the weather and climate. If it is hot, they are bundled up in a heavy cloak, and if it is cold, they are wearing light, loose-fitting clothes.
16. The NPC is engaged in animated conversation with a friend or acquaintance. They both give the characters a double-take before continuing their discussion about “strange goings-on”. (These could be nothing more than local events of no importance or the hook into the characters' next adventure).
17. The NPC is suddenly hit on the back of the head by a mud ball thrown by one of a small group of urchins. The children scatter immediately, and the NPC is left standing in the street angry and muddy.
18. The NPC is new in town and still getting their bearings. Lost, the NPC stops to ask the characters for directions to a local inn.
19. The NPC is chasing a dog (their pet). The dog rushes past the party with a small haunch of meat in its mouth. Behind the NPC, shouts of, “Thief! Stop!” ring out.
20. The NPC is fascinated by adventurers. Spotting the characters, the NPC decides to follow them to see what “high jinks” they get up to. The NPC is not particularly subtle, and it is not long before the characters realise they have a tail… 





# TRAVELLERS' INN 



## FELLOW TRAVELLERS 



1. Raereen Azariarn (CG female half-elf ranger 3) wears a wide-brimmed, feathered hat and a thick, mud-stained traveller's cloak. By the state of her clothes and gear, she has been on the road for days (or even weeks). Raereen is a private person who does not seek out company. She is polite, but distant to strangers and is meeting a friend here at the inn in a few days. Several elven tattoos decorate her face; knowledgeable characters know the symbols signify revenge and fire.
2. Pekko Laso (NE middle-aged male human thief 4) is travelling with his nephew, Reko (CN male human thief 2), to a new home in a nearby town or city. The two fled their home several weeks ago after they robbed the wrong person—a person with connections to the underworld. Pekko is pot-bellied and prematurely greying while his nephew is essentially a younger, fitter— and slimmer—version of his uncle. Both wear good quality travelling clothes. A perceptive character may notice they never let a stuffed backpack out of their sight. Both carry stout walking staves and have concealed several daggers about their persons.
3. Samppa Ora (LE male human magic-user 5) is trying to remain unnoticed and unremarked upon. He has eschewed his usual dark robes for fine traveller's clothes, but the faint smell of spell components—identifiable by other spellcasters—yet hangs in the air about his person. With short blond hair and pale blue eyes Sampppa appears exotic to the ordinary inn folk. He is pretending to be a merchant in search of new business opportunities and has hired a couple of servants (who are unaware of his true identity) to complete the charade. (Samppa's purpose is to find the burial mound of an ancient king said to lie nearby; he has uncovered research suggesting certain powerful items lie within). Characters investigating Samppa's gear might be surprised at how much arcane and exploring equipment the merchant needs.
4. Unto Susi (CN middle-aged male human) is a wandering pedlar intent on reaching the next town or city. Uncomfortable travelling alone, he latches onto the characters and asks to accompany them. Unto offers to help with making camp, cooking and so on as well as mending broken equipment and suchlike. He's not above trying to sell the characters some of his stock as well—most nights around the campfire turn into an “impromptu” sales pitch. With a greying droopy moustache and sad, doleful eyes, Unto is adept at making others feel sorry for him.
5. Soini Torio (LN male human fighter 3) is a wandering mercenary looking for his next job. Equipped with fine scale mail, shield and a warhorse as well as several weapons Soini is a cut above the average wandering sellsword. His hard, flinty eyes have seen many horrible sights, and he'll quick size up the characters. He may travel with them for a while if they are going in the same direction but won't risk his life to save them—unless he is well paid.
6. Etune Highhill (CG female halfling) is travelling to visit some distant relatives. Her sister—Roylla—has been staying with the relatives for almost a year and recently her letters have stopped reaching Etune (who is understandably worried at this development). Above all, Etune is looking for reassurance, and perhaps travelling companions. She's never been far from home before and has only just realised how big the world is and how far she has to go. Friendly, but distracted by her worries, Etune has little to offer the characters if they help her. She travels with her beloved mule—Surnak—who toils under a considerable amount of travelling gar. 





## LOCALS & STAFF 



1. Heikki Kare (LN old male human) is grey-haired, stocky and lame. He totters about the inn with his stick, occasionally whacking—good-naturedly—at people in his way. Heikki is an excellent source of local legends, history and lore. He is, however, lonely and loves to chat with travellers. Sadly, this means the adventurers could be in for a long night.
2. Liisa Jurva (NG middle-aged female human) loves to read, although she doesn't have access to many books. Whenever she has a spare moment, she finds a quiet corner of the taproom and plonks herself down with a book. She gravitates to any newcomers also reading, and begs to take a look at their books. Liisa's hair is going slightly grey, and she looks tired and a little haggard. She does not take well to comments on the subject.
3. Juhani Ilma (N male human) is ever-cheery and loves working at the inn. He is fascinated by distant—particularly non-human—cultures and takes extra care when serving non-humans. He besieges such customers with endless questions about their home, traditions, culture and so on. This lanky, brown-haired, blue-eyed youth has no intention of actually going to any of the places he hears about; his family need him here. When not at the inn, he works to support his family in another local business.
4. Mateli Kulta (CN old female human) has been a fixture at the inn for decades. Now wizened and near-broken from a life of hard labour she spends most of her time telling everyone else what to do. Even though she has a sharp tongue, many locals love her and would not take kindly to visitors being rude to their unofficial matriarch. With her stooped frame, wispy grey hair and startlingly blue eyes She cuts a distinctive figure as she shuffles about the inn.
5. Kaarle Mieli (CN middle-aged male human) is corpulent, unfit and borderline alcoholic. A popular figure he is in failing health and often ill. When he works, he is always hustling for free drinks and can become a traveller's best friend in the blink of an eye.
6. Solalith Natityrr (NG middle-aged male half-elf) is gregarious and amiable, but chronically disorganised. Pot-bellied and short-haired, Solalith is usually encountered wearing work-stained clothes of ill cut. Despite his appearance, Solalith is comparatively wealthy compared to other locals. He works hard and is not afraid of getting his hands dirty. His wife—Rideth—is the organisation brains of the family; he would be lost without her.
7. Sohvi Raita (CN young female human) is the daughter of one of the local families and loves working at the inn. With a shock of long, flame-red hair Sohvi is easily visible among the crowd. Sadly, she is a little forgetful and easily distracted. Her customers often go longer than others without their food or drinks. For all that, though, the rest of the staff love her; always cheerful and smiling Sohvi brightens all but the most miserable crowd. She is learning to sing—she harbours dreams of one day singing for the local ruler—and is easily cajoled into performing. (As a fledgeling entertainer, she knows many local legends, which may be helpful to the party).
8. Kilbir Ovlag (N male dwarf fighter 2) serves as the inn's bouncer. He enjoys his job and has little patience for those daring to endanger the customers or staff. Kilbir is generally in the inn during the evening—when trouble is most likely to occur. Once an adventurer, Kilbir lost his love of the lifestyle after most of his friends died in a disastrous dungeon delve. His black eyes fill with tears when he remembers his slain friends, and he is melancholy even for a dwarf. Kilbir keeps his hair cropped short, but his beard is an unruly mess. 





## TAPROOM DRESSING 



1. A ragged banner hangs from a beam running all the way across the taproom. Heavily smoke-stained and dusty the banner has been in situ for years. It bears the battle flag of a nearby kingdom or barony. (Perhaps one of the staff—or the owner—once served in that kingdom's army).
2. The ceiling is unusually low—too low for hanging lanterns. Thus, at night, light comes from candles on the tables and the taproom's fire. During the day and early evening, the room's windows are thrown wide open to admit light.
3. The tables and chairs are a hodgepodge of styles and finishes. Many show signs of repeated repairs. A polite customer would call the collection eclectic. A snob might call it dilapidated.
4. Smoke stains the brickwork around the taproom's chimney. Firewood fills a nearby nook in the wall, and a long, black wrought iron poker hangs over the fire.
5. Dusty shelves—filled with all manner of curiosities—line one wall. Several discarded tankards and an empty wineskin lie in the shelves' shadowy reaches.
6. The shards of a broken pewter tankard lie under a chair. The surrounding floorboards yet have a faint beer stain.
7. The names of several customers are carved into the characters' table top. The carvings while deep are old; they are worn and stained with the slop from uncountable mugs of beer, glasses of wine and the like.
8. Beams run across the ceiling. Nails affix various squashed, dented or otherwise unusable pewter tankards to the rafters, as decoration. Dust and cobwebs fill most of the tankards; but one or more of the tankards could be an unusual hiding place for some forgotten treasure or trinket.
9. The taproom has several tables and chairs sized for halflings, gnomes and the like. The furniture is not always laid out, but if such a diminutive customer appears, the staff rush to bring them out. Sometimes, they use the furniture for the children of their human customers.
10. Heavy-duty shelves run along the wall behind the bar. Barrels of ale rest on the rack, and it is from these the staff dispense drinks. Expensive drinks—wine, hard spirits and on—fill a locked cabinet.
11. A beautifully carved and stained wooden sign emblazoned with the inn's name hangs behind the bar. The sign is the barkeep's pride and joy; if anyone damages it, they are the target of his—and his regulars'— unending ire.
12. The taproom's wooden tables and benches are unusually heavy. Sometimes, the tables are pushed together to form an impromptu stage for visiting bards, performing troupes and the like.
13. Various stuffed animals—foxes, rabbits, stoats and so on— gaze down at the taproom from shelves along the walls. Many of the stuffed animals are dusty and threadbare suggesting they have been here for a long time. One wolf's head, though, appears freshly stuffed; late in the evening, its eyes seem to shine unnaturally; some characters may also experience the sensation of the head watching them.
14. A threadbare, singed rug of indeterminate colour covers the floor in front of the taproom's fireplace. Here, three dogs—the innkeeper's beloved pets—sprawl contentedly. They eagerly accept any leftover food or drink. Some nights, the dogs get positively tipsy.
15. Barrel lids nailed to the wall behind the bar record all the different ale served (past and present) at the inn. Most have maker's marks burnt into the wood; a few are nothing more than plain lids with names of the ale written in chalk.
16. The taproom has an ornately carved fireplace. A breathtaking work of art, the old stonework depicts coiled and writhing dragons; the level of craftsmanship is entirely out of place for the locale. The fireplace and the chimney are all that remains of a much older building that once stood on the site; the current inn was built in and on the ruins. (Ancient—and perhaps some unknown—cellars lurk deep beneath the inn.)
17. A line of small round tables along one wall comprises nothing more than upturned barrels repurposed for the job. All have much staining from the leavings of decades of drinking; several have inventive graffiti, along with the names of countless travellers, carved into their sides.
18. Many bags and sacks hang from rafters via short lengths of rope. Within, the inn-keep stores all manner of things; customers may also hang their possessions here to keep them safe. For a fee, the inn-keep stores items thusly while customers are away. He also runs a service whereby patrons can leave bags and suchlike for friends or customers to pick up at a later date.
19. A suit of scale mail on a stand dominates a raised plinth in one corner behind the bar. A slender spear leans against the armour; the spear's tip is yet sharp. The gear belonged to a customer who could not pay his bill—the items were his payment. They are for sale.
20. Several tapestries hang from the taproom's walls. All are old, faded and stained with smoke. One depicts a woodland scene while another is merely a series of concentric rings. The final tapestry shows a floundering— obviously doomed—ship under sail in a heavy sea. 





## SIGHTS, SOUNDS & EVENTS 



1. Laughter erupts at a nearby table as four men play a simple dice game of Dragon and the Thief. One of the men is enduring terrible luck, and his fellows are delighting in his ongoing discomfort.
2. A server wends around the tables collecting used plates and tankards. As he passes one table, he stumbles and trips over a chair leg; his tray falls to the ground with a loud crash. After a moment of silence, many of the locals break into spontaneous, good-natured clapping and cheering at this “hilarious” event.
3. The door bangs open, and everyone turns to stare at the newcomers. Two travellers (see “Fellow Travellers") barge their way loudly into the taproom, dump their bags on the floor and shout for the inn-keep.
4. Two drinkers are engaged in a loud discussion about the weather or some other mundane and tremendously dull subject. Neither is listening to the other one, and both are getting increasingly frustrated with the other. A dog— a stray or someone's beloved pet—sneaks under their table and start licking up a pool of spilt ale.
5. Sparks fly from the fire warming the taproom as one of the large logs burning therein falls apart. Part of the burning log rolls out of the fire onto the hearth. A server rushes to return the wood to the fire.
6. A customer sits in one corner trying to entice other patrons into a “friendly” game of chance. He has no luck for a half-hour or so until a couple of fellow drinkers sit down to play. It quickly becomes apparent he is intimately acquainted with the game and a consummate gambler who is surpassingly lucky.
7. Three children—bored into mischief by being forced to sit quietly while their parents eat, drink and chat—begin to misbehave; this culminates in the children breaking into an impromptu, loud and energetic game of tag in the taproom. This has predictably disastrous consequences for the characters' drinks.
8. One of the barrels of ale behind the bar runs dry— service is interrupted while the barkeep and a server manhandle it away and bring up a replacement. Some of the inn's customers are less than patient.
9. A hunter enters the taproom carrying bloody bags filled with meat from his recent kill. He gestures to the innkeep and the two repair to the end of the bar to haggle.
10. A drunk customer bangs his tankard on the table and calls loudly for more ale. When served, he tries to weasel out of paying—and gets angry when he has to cough up the coin for his drink.
11. Two drinkers are engrossed in conversation; they hoist drink after drink and are soon slurring at each other. As they descend into drunkenness, a young boy sneaks over and steals one of their half-finished drinks by swapping it with an empty flagon; neither man notices.
12. Two travellers (see “Fellow Travellers”) sit hunched over their table intently studying a map of the surrounding area—they are plotting their route and are happy to discuss their plan with other travellers as they are new here and want advice on the best way to go. 

## BRAWL TRIGGERS 



1. A traveller insults the inn; the locals are offended.
2. A traveller makes a drunken, lecherous pass at a touchy local's wife or husband.
3. Someone knocks over someone else's drink and refuses to replace it.
4. Someone is caught cheating at cards or dice.
5. A local scallywag is caught failing to pick a pocket.
6. A long-standing feud between locals gets out of hand. 





## BEDCHAMBER DRESSING 



1. A small mound of haphazardly folded blankets of various colours and sizes sits in the corner atop a small clothes chest. The blankets are musty but warm.
2. The bed wobbles; one of its legs is shorter than the others and is propped up on a small lump of wood. Vigorous movement in the bed displaces the shorter leg.
3. The widely spaced floorboards in this room let a faint breeze through the floor; when the taproom is busy, the sounds of revelry are clearly audible.
4. The candle holders affixed to the wall are surprisingly ornate for a travellers' inn. Of brass, they depict rearing serpent heads. The serpents have their mouths opened wide as if about to strike.
5. A clay jug filled with water and two clay mugs stands on a small side table by the window. The water is clean but tepid. The clay mugs are clean but comically small for adult hands.
6. One of the room's shutters is loose on its hinges. If there is any wind at all, it bangs against the window frame. Only the heaviest of sleepers get a decent night's slumber in this room—spellcasters may even fail to get enough rest to prepare their spells the next morning.
7. A threadbare rug covers some of the floor by the bed. Characters pulling up the rug discover an old, yellowed piece of parchment stuck to the back. Hidden long ago (and forgotten) it shows the location of a buried treasure nearby. (By now the cache may have been found or could now lie unknown under someone else's property).
8. The bedchamber's walls are whitewashed, and a local artist has decorated one wall with a view of a prominent local landmark. (The painting could even provide a hook or clue to an upcoming adventure such as a hidden, tree-shrouded ruin and so on).
9. The sigil of a dark, evil god—along with a short prayer calling his attention to whoever sleeps in the room—is carved into the back of the bed's headboard. Perhaps the innkeeper (or one of the staff) is part of an evil cult, or a cult member recently stayed at the inn.
10. A perceptive character notices a floorboard beneath the bed is loose. It conceals a dusty, but sadly empty, storage niche.
11. A small vase of wilting wildflowers stands in the centre of the room's window sill.
12. The chamber has two pegs on the back of its door. One is loose, and falls off during the night—likely waking the chamber's occupant who might assume some kind of sinister doing is in progress. 

## THINGS LEFT BY THE PREVIOUS GUEST 



1. A traveller's pouch lies discarded under the bed. Left here months ago, it is dusty but still contains flint and steel, some char cloth and a length of twine wrapped around two small carved wooden pegs.
2. An off-white shirt—carefully laid out to de-crease it—lies under the bed's mattress. A perceptive character notices the shirt's cuff sticking out from under the mattress.
3. A tiny, worn statuette depicting an octopus crossed with a dragon is hidden in one of the bed's pillows. Obviously old, the statue is a disturbing, blasphemous thing best immediately destroyed. (The individual who left the figurine has realised his error and returns to the inn a few days after the characters move on; ascertaining who stayed in the room he begins to track the party down).
4. The previous guest was paranoid and slept with a dagger under his pillow. It slipped down between the mattress and the headboard during the night. The dagger's scabbard is of supple leather stained a deep brown and has loops to secure it to a belt.
5. A short traveller's cloak sized for a halfling, or a human child, hangs from the back of the bedchamber's door. The cloak is worn, but good quality. It has several inside pockets at the waist. Inside one is a scrap of paper with the message, “Please help me. They are taking me to (insert name of a nearby town), Jarko.”
6. The chamber's bin—a carved and hollowed out length of tree trunk—has not been emptied. Characters searching through the rubbish discover a shredded, bloody sock, some food wrappers and a crumpled piece of parchment. Sadly, the parchment has suffered water damage and is bloodstained; it is illegible.
7. A previous guest did not get on with the inn-keep and left a message crudely carved into the back of the door questioning the landlord's ancestry, honesty and morals. The landlord is unaware of the carving and becomes wildly angry if it is brought to his attention. (Of course, the message would be right about the landlord).
8. The pungent odour of urine and sweat fills this bedchamber. Leaving the door and window open dissipates the smell, but—bizarrely—it returns later. (Investigations—or an unpleasant discovery—reveal the bed's threadbare mattress is suspiciously sodden.) 





# TROUBLESOME TREASURES 



## BULKY TREASURES 



1. A ten-foot square tapestry hangs on one wall. The tapestry depicts a bucolic woodland hunting scene, is worth 50 gp and weighs 120 lbs.
2. A cast iron chandelier easily five-foot across hangs from the ceiling. It has five arms forged to depict writhing dragon heads. Within each dragon's open mouth writhe magical, heatless flames. A long metal rod leaning against the wall enables the user to open or close each mouth to increase or decrease the amount of light. The whole is worth 200 gp but weighs 75 lbs.
3. A huge giant's breastplate has been pressed into service as a brazier. Full of hot coals, the breastplate is heavy (45 lbs.) but finely decorated with intricate lightning bolt engravings picked out with silver. Worth 400 gp, the item is nevertheless worthless as armour because the entire back of the breastplate is missing.
4. A map of the local area showing all significant landmarks and settlements decorates this 15 ft. long, ten-foot wide rug. Of great interest and value to local nobility, the rug is worth 75 gp (but weighs 100 lbs.)
5. This 10-foot tall stone statue depicts a medusa—its snake hair waving about its face—staring down at those in front of it. The figure is (ironically) tremendously detailed and life-like. As a piece of art, it is worth 200 gp (but weighs 2,000 lbs).
6. This long, narrow ornate oak box has a hinged lid decorated with beautiful geometric shapes picked out with wood stain. Displayed within in velvet compartments is a complete set of silver cutlery with enough place settings for a dozen diners. The whole is worth 100 gp but weighs 20 lbs. Dumping the box and keeping the cutlery reduces the value by 20 gp.
7. Of beaten silver, this shallow two-foot-wide bowl could be used for handwashing, holding fruit or as the centrepiece of a formal dining table. It is worth 10 gp.
8. A mass of glass bottles and retorts, along with a small cauldron and dozens of small tools and other pieces of equipment, sit upon a side table. The equipment of a wizard or alchemist, the whole set is worth 200 gp but weighs 40 lbs. If packed carefully, the rest of the equipment is designed to fit into the cauldron (but if packed poorly without padding, most of the glass items won't survive rough handling).
9. This long blood-red ball gown, complete with a short train, is a stunning mix of lace and chiffon and is worth 30 gp. However, although light—only weighing 6 lbs.—it is bulky and must be carefully folded to avoid damage.
10. This thick coil of rope is 400 ft. long and designed to hold twice as much weight as an ordinary rope but is heavy (160 lbs.) and only worth 16 gp.
11. This portable battering ram is crafted from super heavy and dense wood and is tipped with a great wedge of iron shaped like a clenched fist. It is twice as heavy as a typical ram (40 lbs.) and requires two people to swing. It provides a +6 Strength bonus to opening doors.
12. This huge bullseye lantern was crafted for a giant (or perhaps a ship or lighthouse). It burns a pint of oil in three hours but provides double the illumination produced by a standard bullseye lantern. The lantern weighs 6 lbs., is five-foot high and worth 25 gp.
13. These ornate metal scales are large enough to weigh a human being or similarly-sized object. Along with the matching set of weights, the whole is worth 150 gp to a merchant or similar person. However, the scales with the weights weighs 400 lbs.
14. Four tightly rolled bolts of silk—blue, red, yellow and black in colour—fill a large sack. Each roll is worth 25 gp. While light, the sack is bulky.
15. A four-foot square steel cage holds a great mass of dried and oil-soaked wood logs. The oil used to impregnate the wood is particularly fragrant and pleasant. Used to heat noble's houses, the taproom of upmarket taverns and the like, the wood is valuable. The whole mass of wood—weighing 100 lbs.—is worth 20 gp.
16. This iron door bar is intricately engraved with a depiction of two muscular arms grasping each other about the wrists. The bar is worth 20 gp, is seven-footlong and weighs 50 lbs.
17. This high-backed wooden chair is intricately carved. The armrests look like a mass of writhing serpents, and a red velvet cushion provides a modicum of comfort to the user. The chair weighs 100 lbs. and is worth 50 gp to a nobleman or similar person.
18. With a set of draws on either side, this ornate oak desk and been stained a deep brown. Each drawer is lockable, and one has a well-hidden secret compartment. The desk weighs 150 lbs. but with its matching chair (and set of draw keys) is worth 200 gp.
19. These four matching tapestries are only five-foot wide and reach from floor to ceiling. Designed to conceal doors, alcoves or perhaps windows, they are deep red in hue. Each weighs 20 lb. and is worth 10 gp. As a set, however, their value doubles.
20. This chainmail barding—designed for a truly monstrous horse—weighs 80 lbs. and is worth 750 gp. It is so finely made it could be magically enchanted. 





## DIFFICULT TO SELL TREASURES 



1. This skull-shaped medallion is crafted from beaten brass. Covered in verdigris, it has a fell aspect. Symbols of death, suffering and damnation are etched into the skull's forehead.
2. At first glance, this small clay statuette depicts nothing more than a dumpy woman sitting cross-legged on the floor. The figure is poorly sculpted and very old. Although it appears to be nothing more than junk, a collector or sage can identify it as an ancient depiction of the nature goddess.
3. In lurid detail, this disturbing tapestry depicts a slender, bald vampire suckling on the neck of an elven woman. The attack occurs amid the shadows clustering beneath a stand of stunted, gnarled trees. The tapestry is 20-foot square, is rather bulky and weighs 20 pounds.
4. This ornate ivory candlestick holder stands almost twofoot- tall. It depicts a naked, lascivious succubus standing in a provocative, seductive pose with its arms raised high above its head. The demon's face has a look of pure lust upon it. Clearly, the candlestick was commissioned by an evil, depraved individual.
5. Bulky but supple this roll of worn leather is tied together with a length of faded red silk. The roll contains a small selection of torture equipment: different-shaped knives, saws and even a small hand drill. The tools look old and well-used but are clean—perhaps suspiciously so. The leather is of unknown origin...
6. This two-foot-long slender dagger has a hollow hilt and a tiny pipe leading from it to the dagger's tip. The hilt's lid can be unscrewed, and the hollow has a suspicious, cloying smell. Evil cultists use this dagger to poison their foes—sometimes in battle and sometimes on the sacrificial altar.
7. The top of this dwarven skull has been sliced off, and its eye sockets, mouth and other orifices crudely filled with silver. A cast-iron handle has been fused to the skull where the vertebra should be. A hill giant chieftain once used this macabre drinking cup to toast his victories.
8. An intricate carving of a beatific man lying at rest with his hands clasped over his chest decorates the lid of this small, ornate iron box. The box is sealed--welded shut. It feels surprisingly lightweight and contains only fine grey dust and several bone fragments.
9. With a plain, battered leather cover, this small book at first glance, doesn't seem particularly noteworthy. A character perusing the text discovers it comprises several short plays. Written by an unknown hand, all the plays lampoon and deride the kingdom's current ruler. It is a seditious, banned work and is one of a dozen or so copies still in circulation. Those caught with the work are guilty of treason.
10. This ornate scroll holds the deeds to a prominent local landmark such as a bridge, shrine or small fort. Ornately decorated and quite detailed in its description of the property, it looks genuine. While it may—or may not—be genuine, the landmark detailed belongs to a powerful local noble family. Few would willingly tangle with their retainers and servants. 





## FRAGILE TREASURES 



1. This small silver framed piece of artwork hasn't been done with brush and paint; rather, tiny shards of multicoloured glass have been expertly arranged to depict a shimmering sea and a stark, cliff-fringed island. The piece is two-foot square and worth 200 gp (intact).
2. This tall, impossibly thin glass decanter has an elegant handle near its spout. It has been blown to depict a graceful swan's head and has a sold silver stopper. Intact, it is worth 50 gp.
3. These four slender wine glasses have gold leaf around their rims. Clearly old, in places the gold leaf is worn by the touch of many lips. The set is worth 100 gp.
4. This diaphanous red silk dress has a 15-foot-long train. Practically transparent, this robe weighs virtually nothing and is extremely prone to snags and tears. Even wrapping up the dress for transport without due care and attention could damage it. In perfect condition, the dress is worth 250 gp.
5. This fired earthen pot looks like nothing special. A close examination reveals faded runes etched into its base venerating an ancient nature goddess. The pot is old beyond imagining and is exceptionally brittle. It is worth 100 gp to members of the goddess' faith.
6. The cover of this much-thumbed book is coming away from its spine, and several of the pages are ripped and torn. It is a travelogue of far-off lands worth 20 gp.
7. This tiny ivory statuette of a rearing unicorn has a slender, sharp horn. The horn is easily snapped off if the statuette is not carefully wrapped. It is worth 50 gp.
8. A glass chandelier almost three-foot across hangs from the ceiling and supports dozens of small candles. The chandelier is bulky but light and each of the glass pieces have been individually blown. Unfortunately, it was not built to be taken apart easily. Intact, the entire thing is worth 400 gp, but removing and packing it up could take at least an hour.
9. One panel of this door features a beautiful mosaic-like decoration depicting—in black onyx—the four elemental sigils. The beadwork holding the piece in place is old and thin. If the panel is removed hastily, the entire thing falls apart. It is worth 50 gp; broken, the onyx flecks are worth 20 gp.
10. This old, scorched parchment is carefully affixed in a frame. The parchment is so thin it is almost transparent. The faded ink yet depicts a map of some unknown place which, accordingly to its scrawled legend, shows the famed lost cyclops city of Anuk-Ra.
11. This worn set of wooden pipes is perfectly tuned to create haunting melodies when played by a master. The pipes are old and chipped, and the mouthpiece has a hairline crack almost invisible to the naked eye. The pipes are worth 200 gp to a skilled musician, but if not handled carefully, the mouthpieces snap off, rendering the instrument worthless.
12. These ancient, worn platinum coins were minted long ago, far underground by the ancient drow. On one side, they depict a gigantic spider, while on the other, in flowing elven writing, they say “Glory to the Mother.” The coins are so thin they can be easily bent and even snapped. Their worth as antiques is triple that of a normal platinum coin.
13. This slender silver necklace comprises a chain of impossibly thin links. Rough handling sunders the chain and could scatter its links over a wide area. The necklace is worth 55 gp.
14. These shaved diamond flecks are as thin as paper and about the size of a fingernail. Used as coins by an ancient, now destroyed culture, they are much worn by usage and the passage of time. A dozen are present; each is worth 25 gp.
15. This ceremonial walking cane is carved from a single piece of ivory. Decorated with a spiral pattern, it has a fatal crack about one foot up from its tip. Anyone putting any weight on the cane snaps it in half. Intact, it is worth 75 gp.
16. This small iron-bound coffer holds a beautifully crafted glass rose resting on a white cloth. The rose's glass petals are a deep, luscious red colour. The rose is worth 200 gp and the coffer another 10 gp. However, unless the rose is carefully wrapped, it breaks during transport.
17. Gold leaf covers this ceremonial mace. The mace's head is oversized—deliberately forged to look impressive—and is too heavy for its shaft. If used in combat, the head snaps off after the first successful hit. Intact, the mace is worth 180 gp.
18. This bronze statuette depicts a squatting, hideous betentacled monster. Its tentacles are depicting flailing about the beast's head and easily snap off. About a foot high, the statuette is bottom-heavy and topples over if not stored securely (which snaps off several tentacles). The statuette is worth 50 gp.
19. Crafted from a roc's feather, this laughable oversized quill has a solid silver tip. Used to ceremonially sign contracts, land grants, and so on the feather is almost two-foot-long. Dusty and brittle, it is particularly challenging to pack safely. The silver tip is worth 25 gp, and intact the thing is worth 100 gp.
20. This small glass potion vial once held holy water and the silver in the water impregnated the vial so that it glimmers in the light. The vial is worth 25 gp, but unfortunately, its stopper does not fit well. Losing the stopper halves the vial's value. 





## MINOR MAGIC ITEM DRAWBACKS 



1. The item occasionally—and seemingly randomly— radiates light equal to a candle. The owner cannot control when this light appears or disappears.
2. This item's crafter was a glutton. They transferred some of their cravings to the item during the crafting process. Thus, the owner almost always feels hungry. Their appetite would put a starving halfling's to shame.
3. Shadows cluster thickly about the item, creating an aura of gloom and a faint feeling of foreboding for the owner, whenever it is used.
4. The item is 50% heavier than normal but otherwise appears normal.
5. When in use, the item often glows with a random bright light. Roll 1d8: 1—red, 2—orange, 3—yellow, 4—green, 5— blue, 6—indigo, 7—violet, 8—no colour. This makes hiding or using the item surreptitiously difficult at best.
6. The owner's finger and toenails grow at a prodigious rate; necessitating their trimming on almost a daily basis.
7. When the item is held or worn, bright light dazzles the owner and makes their eyes water similarly to how drow suffer in bright light.
8. At some point in the past, the item was exposed to a smell anathema to dogs. Dogs and wolves will not willingly approach the owner. Indeed, they bark and bare their teeth if the item's owner approaches them.
9. Whenever the item's owner uses its power, they hear a faint whispering coming from some indefinable source. The whispering is too quiet to make out any actual words, and no one else can hear them.
10. Owning the item proves disastrous for the possessor's hair. Over the first few weeks of ownership, the owner's hair turns progressively greyer. After a month, it begins to fall out. Getting rid of the item reverses this process over a similar amount of time.
11. Animals hate the item's smell. Domesticated animals—horses, cows and so on—avoid the owner whenever possible; other animals such as dogs react aggressively to the item's presence.
12. Something strange happened during the item's creation. The crafter used some kind of esoteric grey-coloured oil in its creation. Occasionally, the item oozes this oil, making it slippery and staining nearby items.
13. When the item's power is used, the temperature plunges in the immediate surround. Frost forms on the object itself, and the owner can see their breath in the air. The temperature returns to normal after a few minutes.
14. When used, the item becomes extremely hot. It scorches unprotected skin and takes ten minutes to cool down.
15. The item draws some of its power from its possessor's life force. Whenever its power is called forth, the owner suffers a terrible headache and takes 1 point of damage.
16. The smell of burning wood hangs in the air around the item. Creatures with a good sense of smell can detect the owner from twice the normal distance (unless other more pungent smells fill the air).
17. While possessing the item, the owner sleeps badly and often has bags under their eyes.
18. Calling forth the item's powers causes the owner's ears to ring as if they had heard repeated loud noise.
19. The item is crafted from strange or repellent material. A scroll could be scribed on flayed skin, a wand could comprise a carved bone wand and so on.
20. The item's previous owner was beset by misery and depression. In their last few minutes of life (before a violent death) their feelings of negativity imprinted themselves on the item. In times of high stress, the item psychically radiates the feelings onto its owner. 





## MINOR CURSES IN A MAGIC ITEM 



1. While they possess this item, the owner begins to believe their comrades and friends covert it. While this feeling does not grow into a homicidal maniac, the owner carefully safeguards the item and refuses to lend it to anyone.
2. The owner grows increasingly obsessed with the item. First, they merely keep it safe, but their obsession slowly grows. After a while, they buy a nice pouch (or similar suitable container) to keep it in. Then, a newer, more expensive bag (perhaps made of particularly fine material or decorated with small gemstones and so on). This expenditure slowly increases and increases.
3. The cursed item radiates a subtle field that attracts the undead. Unintelligent undead prefer to attack the wielder above all other targets and intelligent undead feel drawn to the item. They do all they can to possess it.
4. The item interferes with the magic of healing spells, magic items and effects, reducing their effectiveness. Such magic effects heal one less point of damage per die rolled.
5. The item is highly magnetised and attracts electrical attacks and effects. The owner suffers a -1 penalty to saving throws made to resist or avoid such attacks. Every day, these effects are cumulative; for every such effect damaging the owner, the saving throw penalty increases by 1 point. The stored magnetism dissipates overnight.
6. The item draws power from its possessor, draining them. The owner must eat and drink twice as much to maintain their weight and health. (Over time, owning this item could be very expensive indeed…)
7. The owner experiences delusions of grandeur and becomes convinced they should be leading the party. They are convinced they know the best way forward and, as time progresses, becomes more and more unwilling to accept other's council.
8. A werewolf once owned this item. The owner's body hair begins to grow dramatically during the days immediately preceding the full moon. This could lead the paranoid or superstitious observer to conclude the owner is a lycanthrope.
9. The wielder becomes susceptible to bright light. They are dazzled in a similar fashion to a draw in such areas.
10. The item renders the owner partially deaf. This makes casting spells with verbal components difficult and means the owner often shouts instead of speaking. 





# URBAN CHASES 




## ALLEYWAY CHASE 




### DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. Two men stagger along the alley, carrying heavy sacks. Intent on their task, they do not notice the characters.
2. Several beggars shelter in the alleyway. They paw pathetically at passersby, desperate for coin, food or strong alcohol.
3. A small boy plays in the mud, and pelts passersby with mud balls (once they have reached a safe distance).
4. Sunlight reflects off a pool of rank water, potentially dazzling a character for a round or two.
5. A man leans against the wall, urinating. He is in no hurry, and won't move for anyone.
6. Two cloaked figures are in the middle of some nefarious deal when the chase enters the alleyway. They both assume the chasing parties are the watch and bolt in different directions, perhaps adding to the confusion.
7. A young girl sits in the mud playing with a mongrel puppy. The dog barks ferociously at the character's sudden appearance and nips at their ankles.
8. Without a warning cry, someone hurls the contents of a full chamberpot into the alleyway from an upper storey window. Unlucky characters could get hit by the excrement and be temporarily blinded or may slip in the suddenly appearing slippery puddle. 

### NIGHTTIME EVENTS 



1. Two thugs lurk in the alley, waiting for prey. They sense opportunity and pounce during the chase.
2. A drunk sits slumped against a wall. His legs stick out in the alley and he (hilariously) tries to trip up a character running past. If he succeeds, he finds this hilarious.
3. Thick clouds pass in front of the moon, plunging the alleyway into deeper darkness.
4. The noise of the chase provokes angry shouts from many of the buildings facing the alley; consequently, it is easy for the pursuer to keep track of their quarry's position.
5. The character hears an urgent whisper, as someone tries to entice them into a nearby shack to hide. This could be a genuine offer of help or the prelude to a mugging.
6. The character runs straight into the middle of a mugging. If they stop to help, the muggers attack them; if they ignore the mugging, the muggers ignore them. If the victim survives they might blame the characters for their predicament and seek revenge at a later date.
7. A stray dog noses about the alleyway in search of scraps. At the characters' approach, it could be aggressive or overly friendly. In either regard, the dog's attention may slow down the character. A. Aggressive (01-10): The dog growls, bares it teeth and bites at anyone getting too close. B. Friendly (11-20): The dog wags its tail, jumps up and tries to follow the character (hoping for food, attention and love).
8. Two drunks stagger along, arm and arm. In a jovial mood, they try to get them involved in a sing-along. Unless threatened with violence, they keep trying to get the character to join them for a drink and a song. They are intensely annoying. 

### OBSTACLES 



1. A whore and her client appear oblivious to the oncoming runners. They make no attempt to get out of the way, and the client reacts angrily if disturbed.
2. A pool of slippery vomit and excrement covers the ground. Inattentive characters may slip and fall.
3. A semi-feral, skinny dog licks furiously at a lumpy pool of vomit. It barks furiously at, and tries to bite, anyone interrupting its meal.
4. The sharp shards of a broken barrel lie against the wall and could trip (or cut) the unwary. A character could also throw the broken barrel behind them to slow pursuit.
5. A body lies facedown in the alley, amid a slowly spreading pool of fresh (slippery) blood and entrails. Two mangy cats lap at the blood but scatter at the character's approach.
6. A pitiful pile of belongings—thrown from a nearby house —litter the alley. A crying woman kneels among the objects sobbing while a man shouts insults from an upper window.
7. Slippery, foul-smelling mud comprises the alley floor. Characters moving swiftly may slip and fall in the mud. Such characters arise coated in the foul-smelling, slippery stuff.
8. The noise of the chase provokes angry shouts from many of the buildings facing into the alley; consequently, it is easy to keep track of the pursued individual.

## ROOFTOP CHASE 




### DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. A roof tile cracks beneath the character's feet. Unless they catch themselves, the character could slip and fall.
2. The character disturbs a worker fixing a tile. Surprised the worker moves straight into the character's path.
3. As #2, but the worker stumbles and slips from the roof. They catch themselves but dangle precariously above the street and desperately call for aid. If it is not forthcoming, they plummet to the street below; serious injury or death results.
4. The character disturbs a nesting bird (or two) that bursts forth from its hidden nest. The surprise of the bird's appearance could cause the character to swerve off course, skid to a halt or even fall from the roof.
5. Sun glints off a metal object, perhaps dazzling or temporarily blinding a character.
6. Angry shouting from folk in the building below follows the character across the rooftops.
7. Three cats lie sunning themselves on the roof's parapet. They hiss and spit at approaching characters.
8. A watch patrol passes below in the street. They see the chase and rush to intercept the characters. 

### NIGHTTIME EVENTS 



1. The character literally bumps into a thief using the roof as a highway. The thief could be on the way to, or coming back from, a job. If the thief has already done their job, they drop their loot in surprise at the character's sudden appearance.
2. The character disturbs a colony of bats that take to the air in a great fluttering cloud. The bats could startle, distract or buffet the character.
3. An assassin is using the roof to stealthily approach their target. The assassins wants no witnesses and, thus, attacks the character.
4. A sudden fierce downpour renders the rooftops slick and reduces visibility.
5. The chase is making a lot of noise. Someone in the building below begins to hysterically shout of murder, assassins and thieves; the watch is called.
6. A cat slinks through the darkness on the hunt for a bird, rat or other tasty morsels. Inattentive characters might stand on the cat—maybe killing the creature and perhaps making them slip into the street below.
7. An assassin—or just a disgruntled thief seeking revenge against a rival—lurks on the roof ready to push a stone onto their target when they pass by.
8. Clouds scud across the moon banishing what faint moonlight was illuminating the rooftops. Below, the streets and alleys are chasms of darkness. 

### OBSTACLES 



1. A section of the roof is weak and collapses as the character runs across it. Unless the character is nimble, they could fall into the room below.
2. The gap between buildings is wider than normal, and the character must leap to cross it. If they fail, they could fall to the street below.
3. A small group of minor wizards stand atop the roof observing weather patterns (during the day) or the stars and planets (at night). The character's appearance creates confusion and anger in their ranks. Some wizards try and get out of the way while others curse (and perhaps even punish the characters with a nonlethal spell or two).
4. A line of fluttering washing lies across the route of the chase. Characters must duck under the washing or lose a round or two enmeshed in its slightly damp embrace. Additionally, the washing obscures sight of what lies beyond, making this a good place for an ambush.
5. Workers have piled new tiles, a great mass of thatch or replacement wooden beams in preparation for repairing the roof.
6. Two lovers have crept up to the roof for some private alone time. They do not hear the chase until a character is literally on top of them. In the ensuing chaos, someone could slip and fall from the roof.
7. A section of roof being prepared for extensive repair is covered by nothing but a tarpaulin. An inattentive character might not realise the danger and fall into the space below.
8. Rival thieves—or perhaps two entire rival gangs—fight atop the roofs of this district or block. Their skirmish causes innumerable obstacles—fallen combatants, knots of struggling thieves, dropped bags of loot and the like— for the characters to navigate.

## SEWER CHASE 




### EVENTS 



1. Several starving giant rats, in search of food, emerge from cracks in a wall and attack the nearest character.
2. The loud rumbling of a cart in the street above startles the character who might fall slip and fall into the sewer as a result of the shock.
3. A large bubble rises to the surface of the sewer and bursts, releasing a noxious stench into the air.
4. The character spots a shadowy figure up ahead in the sewer. The figure could be a lurking thief up to no good (1-3), a beggar (4-5) or a sewer worker (6) inspecting or repairing something in the vicinity.
5. A loud splash echoes through the air; ahead something large has just fallen into the sewer. Variously, this could be a body (or something else) being dumped, some kind of large predator or a small collapse.
6. A sudden, loud influx of waste makes hearing anything else difficult for several rounds as the sound echoes loudly through the sewer.
7. Something large moves in the sewer's dank, opaque water, leaving a wake amongst the murk. It could be nothing more than a large submerged branch or it could be something far more dangerous—a snake, a monstrously large eel adapted to sewer life or something even worse.
8. The character disturbs a pair of footpads doing away with the remains of their most recent victim. They want no witnesses and attack the character. 

### OBSTACLES 



1. A thick crust of slippery effluent covers the walkway; those moving too quickly or not paying attention could slip and fall into the sewer.
2. Part of the sewer's stone walkway has crumbled away. The characters must jump the five-foot gap to continue on their way or end up in the filthy water.
3. A rusty locked gate bars the walkway. The character must either jump into the sewer channel, leap across to the other walkway, go back the way they came or break through the gate to continue on their way.
4. A small swarm of rats gnaw on the filth-covered body of a human slumped on the walkway. A dagger sticks from the man's back and the rats vicious defend their meal.
5. A blockage has created a veritable dam of congealed excrement, bits of wood, detritus and other rubbish. Effluent has nearly crested the slick, stinking dam, which may—or may not—be safe to cross.
6. Two thieves lurk in the sewer plotting their next job. Predacious fellows, they attack any lone or separated character, in search of an easy score.
7. The walkway is slimy and redolent with waste. Incautious characters may slip and fall (perhaps into the sewer's foul, sluggishly flowing water).
8. Because of a local blockage, this part of the sewer is flooded, and the character must wade through thighhigh sewer water; hidden obstacles and deeper sections lurk to snare the unwary or rushing character.

## STREET CHASE 




### DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. With only a brief warning cry, someone hurls the contents of a full chamberpot into the road. Unlucky characters could get hit by the excrement and be temporarily blinded or slip in the suddenly appearing puddle of filth.
2. A drunk mercenary tries to trip the character, hoping the watch might reward him.
3. It begins to rain heavily, reducing visibility.
4. A mounted warrior forces his horse through the throng, in search of an inn for the night. Tired and irritated at the crowds, he makes no attempt to get out of the character's way and takes great delight in slowing them down and generally being difficult.
5. A peddler pushes a handcart through the throng. Desperate for a sale, they accost a character—thrusting a sample of their wares into the character's face and so on.
6. A full cart rumbles along the street. Characters moving quickly and unpredictably could spook the horses, creating chaos, confusion and disruption in their wake. The wagon might even shed its load.
7. Townsfolk stand and stare at the characters chasing t h ro ugh t h e c rowd. S ome s h o u t wo rds o f encouragement, others taunt one or both parties.
8. The character knocks over an innocent passerby, who falls to the floor and drops their shopping. Instantly, beggars and street urchins fall upon the dropped items. 

### NIGHTTIME EVENTS 



1. Drunken revellers wander down the street singing lustily. They stagger about, singing and laughing and could easily cause an obstruction for running characters.
2. A watch patrol walks the streets, keeping an eye out for suspicious or nefarious behaviour. They spot the chase and, in turn, give chase intent on catching both parties. They call loudly for aid from other nearby patrols.
3. A man pushes a handcart up the street. He stops and begins to collect several lumps of horse manure. (A steaming pile of the stuff already fills his barrow.)
4. The character hears an urgent whisper, as someone entices them into a nearby building to hide. This could be a genuine offer of help or the prelude to a mugging.
5. A weary mud-splattered traveller leading a tired horse walks up the street searching for an inn for the night.
6. Two lovers stroll arm in arm along the street. At sight of the chase, one of the lovers decides to impress the other by trying to restrain the character.
7. A drunken barbarian staggers along the street drinking from a wine flask. He is not looking where he is going and has a touchy temper. Violence could ensue, if the character bumps into, or knocks over, the barbarian.
8. A shadowy figure beckons to the character. The figure—a low-level thief—could offer the pursued a place to hide or show the pursuer a shortcut to get ahead of their quarry. Either way, the thief wants paying. 

### OBSTACLES 



1. An empty wagon, and a bored-looking horse, stand stationary in the road. The teamster kneels at the back of the wagon, as he examines something underneath it.
2. A patrol of four members of the watch march down the street, two abreast. Townsfolk step aside to let them pass temporarily creating an area of denser crowd.
3. A half-dozen laughing, running children run through the street, playing a game of catch. The character could get tangled up among the children who might not realise the deadly seriousness of the chase.
4. Stalls line the street, forcing those passing into a narrower section of the road. Several oblivious people browse the stalls, creating additional obstructions.
5. A minor fire has broken out in a nearby building. Smoke wafts across the street, as a dozen or so townsfolk attempt to fight the smouldering blaze.
6. A solemn funeral march or the like—processes up the street. The mourners do not take kindly to distractions or disturbances and lash at the character.
7. A building has collapsed and is in the process of being rebuilt and repaired. A pile of building materials— guarded by several self-important urchins—partially blocks the street.
8. An important person—perhaps a nobleman, priest or wizard—is abroad in the town on personal business. If the character knocks the person over, gets in their way or otherwise inconveniences them, the NPC may cast a spell, report them to the authorities or exact their revenge in some other subtle (or unsubtle) way.

## OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLICATIONS 



1. The chase takes place close to where a sergeant or captain of the watch is inspecting a double-strength patrol. Hearing the ruckus the officer, followed—perhaps reluctantly—by the patrol sets off to investigate (and quell) the disturbance.
2. The nearest watch patrol happens to comprise corrupt and easily bribable guards. For a small amount of coin, they can intervene, not intervene or release anyone captured during the chase, as appropriate.
3. A character resembles a notorious criminal high up on the watch's wanted list. Any members of the watch “recognising” the character gives chase. Alternatively, a mistaken informer follows the characters back to their lodging and then reports them to the watch—who arrive shortly thereafter to arrest the unfortunate character.
4. The person the characters were chasing has a powerful local friend or enemy. A. Friend (01-10): The NPC seeks out the party to have their revenge on behalf of their friend. They might try rubbishing the characters' reputations or hire thugs to rough up (or kill) them. This NPC could become a reoccurring thorn in the characters' side. B. Enemy (11-20): The NPC is delighted with the characters if they caught their quarry and seeks them out to thank them. If the characters failed to catch their foe, the NPC offers the characters assistance. Either way, the characters could make a new, useful friend who might be the source of future adventures.
5. The chase happened near the scene of another major crime. Perhaps someone important was murdered or a major theft occurred. The characters were seen running in the vicinity and are urgently sought for questioning.
6. The chase resulted in significant property damage, and the characters are pursued to settle the bill.
7. A high-ranking member of the watch seeks out the characters and offers them positions in the organisation.
8. A character develops a bad sprain or sprain, after the chase. Their speed is reduced by half for a week (or until they are magically healed).

## MINOR EVENT HOOKS 



1. An acquaintance of one of the characters is involved in the event and asks the characters to attend, help out or investigate as appropriate.
2. A flyer detailing the event is thrust into a character's hand. The flyer could be advertising an upcoming event, protesting an event (past or present), or asking for help somehow. For example, if a crime has been committed, the flyer could be offering a reward for the capture of the perpetrator.
3. If the event has yet to happen, the characters hear a town crier extolling its virtues. Alternatively, if the event has already happened, the crier could have been employed by the watch or the victim to seek witnesses or by a business to advertise their new service.
4. The event happens to the characters, or they stumble into the middle of it. For example, they could get caught up in a tavern brawl. Alternatively, it could happen at or to one of their favoured venues. For example, a fire could damage or destroy their favourite tavern while one of their preferred shops could be burgled.
5. The party hears rumours the event is a front for, or the result of, some kind of nefarious activity. For example, a tavern brawl was used as cover for a murder, a fire was far from accidental and so on. Will they investigate?
6. The characters overhear two locals talking excitedly about the event. Either they are swapping stories about what happened (if the event has already occurred) or are wildly speculating about what might happen.
7. The characters are obviously adventurers. If the event is a negative one (such as a horrible murder), one or more of the townsfolk demand the characters investigate and bring the perpetrator to justice. If the event is otherwise— for example, a new shop opening—locals expect the characters to support the new business with a hefty purchase or ongoing patronage. If they refuse in either instance, their local reputation suffers.
8. The event is contentious. For example, some might think a criminal scheduled for execution is innocent, two rival shops may be fighting for business and so on. In any event, the characters are drawn into the situation by passersby, a friend or (perhaps) the authorities. D12 EVENT SUITABLE HOOKS




## TAVERN BRAWL 



1. The Parrot and Parsnip
2. The Bard's Head
3. The Orc's Head
4. The Silverleaf
5. The Nine Feathers
6. Complication: The brawl is serious, and someone is killed. If the killer is caught, they are sentenced to death. Reroll this result to determine the brawl's location.


## NEW NOTABLE SHOP 



1. Bargle's Emporium: Bargle sells all manner of curiosities, exotic items and the like; the shop also contains a small display of life-like waxworks.
2. CJ's Importers: Dealing in the import of wines and spirits, CJ's Importers seeks wealthy, discerning customers (or just drunks with a lot of money).
3. Salme's Apothecarium: Salme specialises in natural healing and remedies for those who do not like—or cannot afford—magical healing. Her shop gives off the heady scent of a vast number of herbs and concoctions. Dogs, and other creatures with sensitive smells, quickly learn to avoid the place.
4. Nikolai's Magic Shop: Nikolai purports to deal in magical items—acting as a go-between in this lucrative market, asking only for a commission in return for his services. His place of business is well-appointed and seemingly well guarded. However, the guards are in on Nikolai's scheme. Nikolai holds the items for sale in his shop. Once he has gathered enough magical items, he simply disappears—quickly moving on before the items' owners realise they've been duped.
5. Jora's Weapons & Armour: Jora specialises in cheap and basic, but reliable, weapons and armour. If you are outfitting a mercenary band or group of retainers, this is the place to shop.
6. The Thoroughbred: This business operates from a farmhouse and attendant outbuildings just outside the town. They sell all manner of horses and can even provide warhorses.

6. Arson: The fire was deliberate and the work of an arsonist, evil cult or the like. It is the first of several similar events. Roll again, to determine the fire's severity.


## MAJOR BURGLARY 



1. Kusti Leino: The thief is said to have filched the rings from Kusti's hands while he slumbered! Kusti has always been a heavy sleeper, but he swears he was drugged or the victim of sorcerous doings.
2. Mikael Kare: This wealthy merchant surprised the burglar and was trussed up like a pig for his trouble. Mikael was discovered by his servants the next morning in a compromising position.
3. Reetta Lempiä: Thieves burst into Reeta's home while she entertained some well-to-do friends. The thieves took all their jewellery and clothes and forced them out into the street while they ransacked the house. Reeta is said to be humiliated and intent on revenge.
4. Filpus Toivas: Flipus resisted the trio of thugs who broke into his house in the dead of night. They savagely beat him but got away with nothing of consequence.
5. Bargle's Emporium: This shop of curiosities was broken into but virtually nothing was taken. The thieves took several minor table decorations and one of the shop's lifelike waxworks. (See “New Notable Shops” #1).
6. Complication: Someone was killed during the burglary. This could be a guard, innocent bystander or important person. If the person killed was important or wealthy, the watch is actually searching for the culprit Reroll this result, to determine who was burgled. 


## A WONDROUS SALE

## LOCAL FAIR OR FESTIVAL



1. Flower Festival: Every year, when the first Blue Drops flower, the locals hold a festival of thanks. Locals come together to sing, dance and give thanks to nature and her bountiful gifts.
2. Festival of “Sir” Ozloc: “Sir” Ozloc was not a formal knight of the realm but was nevertheless a champion of the commonfolk. “Sir” Ozloc was part of several adventuring parties working to protect the town. The sole survivor of all these parties, it was always “Sir" Ozloc who made it back to town to warn of impending danger. The festival involves foot races, games of hide and seek, dramatisations of the hero's most incredible escapes and so on. Heavy drinking and merriment always ensue.
3. All's Fair: The local lord lays on a feast for several hundred commoners every year. Locals are invited in recognition of their service to the community or as a result of a hefty bribe to certain officials. All's Fair takes place in the courtyard of the lord's castle and is a splendid affair. Bards, entertainers and the like are in abundance, as is the food and drink. Invitation to the fair bestows a certain cachet to those attending.
4. Knights' Eve: In bygone years, a band of knights saved the town from the depredations of a crazed gang of merciless ogres. The locals celebrate their heroics with song, dance and dramatic reenactments.
5. Dance of the Mad: This local celebration is little more than an excuse for fun and frolics. Nominally, the festival commemorates the day when the inmates escaped from a local insane asylum. The escapees cavorted from the asylum, and the locals dance and drink to mark the anniversary. Few now recall the day's dark events: several staff and alienists were murdered when the inmates broke out.
6. By the Water: This busy market and fair takes place on the waterfront or riverbank. Many stalls and visiting traders are waterborne, and customers must visit their vessels to be entertained or buy their goods. This could be a monthly, seasonal or yearly event.


## PUBLIC EXECUTION 



1. Pieti Hopea: Guilty of theft and murder, Pieti is to be hanged by the neck.
2. Niko Joutsimies: Guilty of trafficking with dark powers, Niko is to be burnt to death.
3. Paavo Hirvi: Guilty of poisoning his wife, Paavo is to be boiled alive in tar.
4. Osma Kaipia: Guilty of counterfeiting, Osma is to be boiled alive in oil.
5. Lempo Arpia: Guilty of banditry and theft, Lempo is to suffer on the breaking wheel.
6. Complication: Something notable happens during the execution. For example, the criminal escapes, the execution fails somehow, the condemned is spared at the last minute and so on. Reroll this result.


## BRUTAL MURDER 



1. Vilppu Untamo: Found dead in his home, Vilppu's face and hands were horribly blackened as if by some kind of horrible poison or wasting disease. His house was comprehensively ransacked.
2. Risto Tuuli: Found dead in a quiet side street, Risto had been stripped naked and decapitated. His head was found a short distance away floating in a rain barrel.
3. Sikke Koveri: Sikke was killed by her husband, Reko, over a trivial matter. Reko is convinced an evil spirit possessed him, but he has been sentenced to be boiled alive nevertheless.
4. Perttu Keiho: Killed in broad daylight, by a slab of falling masonry, Perttu's death was first ruled an accident. However, the mason responsible for the building's upkeep swears the facade is in good repair and cannot find any damage to repair.
5. Sonja Rintala: Slain on the street outside her own home by a deranged lunatic who accused her of various sinister, unspeakable crimes Sonja was a beloved member of the community. Since her death, her house has been at the centre of a series of strange sounds and odd events.
6. Armi Sianio: Some thought Armi was a white witch. The mad gnome Daladin Neblor believed otherwise and brutally slew her after she jokingly threatened to turn him into a kobold. Daladin is now vigorously sought by the watch.



## BRIGANDS AND BANDITS 



1. Small Band: The band is small and poorly led. They quickly fall foul of the lord's troops and are wiped out.
2. Daring Highwaywoman: The band is nothing more than a daring highwaywoman and her three devoted lackeys. She is brave, beautiful and has a wicked sense of humour. She quickly becomes beloved by the populace, much to the local merchants' and authorities' chagrin. A large reward for her capture goes unclaimed.
3. Large Band: A large bandit group moves into the area. After several weeks they move on before the local lord's men-at-arms can locate their camp.
4. Large Band: A large bandit gang moves into the area and establishes a hidden camp. They haunt the local roads and become progressively more aggressive.
5. Motley Humanoids: A disparate band of humanoids— orcs, goblins and hobgoblins—from destroyed tribes coalesces around a half-orc of unusual power and cunning. Clearly, adventurers caused this mess, and adventurers should sort it out.
6. Complication: The brigands are more than mere bandits—they are in the employ of the local lord's rival. They have been paid to make life as difficult as possible for merchants, traders and commoners alike. They are black-hearted and merciless.



## ILLNESS STRIKES 



1. Dirty Water: Several people get sick, and one person dies after a local water source is contaminated with the corpse of a dead sheep. The perpetrator is not caught.
2. Food Poisoning: An outbreak of severe food poisoning centres on a tavern—the Rusty Axe—of poor repute. Five people die, and the owner flees town.
3. Sick Visitors: Illness strikes the town days after a large merchant caravan arrives. Naturally, suspicion for the contagion falls on the visiting merchants.
4. Undiagnosed Lycanthropy: A local hunter is bitten by a werewolf but survives the attack. A rash of savage murders besets the town on the next full moon.
5. Magical Sickness: A sickness of apparent supernatural origin strikes the town. Several townsfolk quickly die. The illness could stop as abruptly as it started, or it could rapidly worsen.
6. Plague: Plague strikes the town; panic ensues. 





## ODD WEATHER 



1. Heavy Rain: Heavy rain lashes the town for 1d6 days. As the storm continues, the roads turn to mud, cellars flood and people shelter indoors. Much of the town's everyday life grinds to a halt until the storm passes.
2. Snow: Snow falls on the town for 1d4 days, irrespective of the season. If this is particularly unseasonal weather, many locals believe the nature god is signalling their displeasure for some reason. Everyday life is paralysed until the snow melts.
3. Strange Lights: Strange lights play across the sky on the night of the new moon. The lights are so bright folk can be abroad at night without artificial lights. Many commoners believe the lights to be of magical origin.
4. Hot: It is unseasonably hot for 1d3 weeks. Some folk enjoy the extra warmth while farmers and the like worry about what it will do to their crops.
5. Gloomy Weather: Heavy clouds hang over the town for the best part of a week. It does not rain, but the gloom is so intense several folk—nervously—joke a powerful magic-using vampire has come to the town.
6. Gales: Powerful winds bring rain and the potential for flooding in low-lying areas. The gales last for 1d3 days.


## VISITING MERCHANT 



1. Eljas Toivettu: Eljas (LG male human) deals in trained birds of prey, and has two eagles, four hawks and a huge white owl for sale. In particular, the owl attracts much attention for its rarity and beauty.
2. Eero Kalpio: Eero (NG male human) deals in the mundanities of life, and knows his products are not exciting or rare. To entice his customers to his travelling emporium, he employs a troupe of entertainers— jugglers, actors, singers and the like. He comes to town several times a year, and his visits are much anticipated.
3. Nallon Glanhak: Nallon (LN male dwarf fighter 4) brings a small shipment of dwarf-crafted armour and weapons to town.
4. Priitta Hellikki: Priitta (N female human) deals in fine furs and has come to town to buy and sell. She has several large bear pelts for sale.
5. Miina Antero: Miina (LE female human thief 6) ostensibly deals in large, bulky goods—bolts of common cloth, flour and so on. Her wagons bulge with goods but are a cover for her true profession—smuggling.
6. Complication: The merchant arrives in town having just been robbed. Roll again, to see who has been robbed. 





# URBAN LANDMARKS 



## MAJOR URBAN LANDMARKS 



1. THE EBON SHARD This eldritch shard of black rock hovers above a plinth of smooth black stone. Softly glowing arcane symbols decorate the floating lozenge-shaped stone. The shard is roughly 30 ft. long. It pre-dates the surrounding settlement. • Detect magic, or a similar spell, reveals the shard and plinth radiate powerful alteration magic. While the stone's runes are arcane sigils, scholars who have researched them have declared them to be essentially gibberish as they are arranged in no known pattern. • Locals report that the ground around the shard sometimes gently shakes. • One night a year, the townsfolk gather to stand vigil over the stone. They set small bonfires around the shard— ringing it with fire and flame—and burn effigies of various devils and demons. A carnival atmosphere ensues: the locals sing, pray and dance; some engage in libidinous acts in the soft shadows cast by the bonfires.
2. ERI' S MARVELOUS MECHANICAL CLOCK A four-storey triangular tower stands atop an artificial mound. A giant clock of surpassing complexity and beauty pierces the top of the tower's three sides. The clock keeps accurate time, although it relies on a small cadre of workers to maintain its workings. • Eri Forgan was an artificer of surpassing skill and cunning. He also had a huge ego. The Marvellous Mechanical Clock is his greatest achievement. • Legend has it, the tower contains a secret clock, which counts down to an unknown momentous, or calamitous, event of great import to the town. • The local lord has recently instigated a Clock Tax to pay for the mechanical clock's upkeep. Few commoners are happy paying this tax—why do they need to know the exact time?
3. THE GUILD HALL This ornate, many pillared building oozes wealth and privilege. Once a temple, the building is now a meeting place for craftsfolk and merchants. Expanded repeatedly over the years as more and more wealth flowed into its coffers, the Guild Hall is now the town's mercantile heart. • The temple fell into a local merchant's hands when the clergy defaulted on their debts. Uninterested in bankrolling their faith, he kicked them out and turned the temple into his home—the grandest in the town—and place of business. • The temple's catacombs yet lie beneath the main building, but they have been sealed for centuries. They are not all but forgotten. • The Guild Hall is the place to find merchants and craftsfolk for virtually any commission.
4. THE HANGING GARDEN Built by an eccentric druid, this rambling one-storey inn looks at first glance to be a low hill. Trees, shrubs and a profusion of wildflowers grow atop its flat roof. Hanging flowers form a many-hued curtain through which guests must pass. Inside, the inn is dim and cool. Wisteria clad pagodas atop the inn's roof provide open-air dining or sleeping venues. • The inn's founder—Ankasi Silverson—is buried in the rooftop garden. Some say his ghost watches over the garden and punishes those despoiling its natural beauty. • The Hanging Garden is popular with elves, rangers and other outdoor types visiting town. • As well as excellent food, drink and unique accommodation, the Hanging Garden also offers a range of natural healing services using the herbs and plants growing in its garden.
5. ISLE OF THE DAMNED The Isle of the Damned is visible from almost any vantage point in the city, but few of its citizens visit the place, and even fewer of them want to visit the isle. The Isle of the Damned serves as a hospice for those suffering from terminal ailments, virulent diseases or incurable madness. Few who set foot on the isle return to their friends or family. Rumours about the isle are legion. • Thousands of have died on the isle, over the years. Their bones choke the island's ground, the level of which is substantially higher than it once was. The restless spirits of those who have died on the isle haunt the place. • A single rambling building stands upon the isle, and a low stone wall runs along the isle's perimeter. At two equidistant points, worn steps breach the wall and lead down to small jetties. • Foul doings happen on the Isle of the Damned. Some of the staff are in league with a deathless necromancer who dwells deep in the island's bowels.
6. THE LIGHTLESS BURROW A super-dense ridge of granite cuts the town near in two. Instead of quarrying or removing the granite, the town's founders burrowed through it, creating a tunnel for swift passage from one side of town to the other. The tunnel is wide enough for pedestrian traffic, but carts and other conveyances are barred from entering. The watch control both ends of the tunnel. • When the dwarven miners cut the tunnel, the work intersected a network of deeper tunnels. The dwarves hid access to the deeper caverns and passageways behind cunningly wrought secret doors. • Sometimes, at night, lone travellers go missing in the Lightless Burrow. • Natural fissures in the rock enable airflow from above. When the conditions are right, a powerful breeze flows through the tunnel. • Option: Combine the Lightless Burrow with the Tower of Ezen-Kar or the Old Chapel. 
7. MARSH MEADOW Marsh Meadow is aptly named. A burgeoning town once stood on the site, but severe and repeated flooding saw the settlement abandoned after much of it sunk into the mire. The vast majority of the buildings are now long gone—their wood and thatch construct consigning them to oblivion. The stone remains of the old church and rectory along with a small shell keep yet remain above the mire. • Whenever Marsh Meadow floods the townsfolk avidly wait for the floodwaters to retire. Sometimes, the flooding brings shiny trinkets and other treasures, lost when the town flooded, to the surface. • Exploring Marsh Meadow is dangerous. Deep patches of quickmire, with properties similar to quicksand, sometimes drown the unwary. • Lights are sometimes seen on Marsh Meadow at night. Superstitious folk ascribe them to the spirits of those killed when the town sunk. Others believe the lights belong to smugglers, thieves and other near-do-wells. • Option: The Nowhere Arch stands at the end of the overgrown road leading to Marsh Meadow.
8. THE NOWHERE ARCH This wide archway once provided access to a grand home of uncertain history. The home is long gone, but its impressively stout entrance remains. A street now passes through the archway, and hundreds—if not thousands—of people use it every day. Strange runes and sigils decorate the arch's vaulted ceiling. • At certain times of the year, when the stars are right, the archway acts as a gateway to other places—or so lurid rumours suggest. Consequently, some locals want the archway torn down, and the stones carted far away. Others believe this would release a great evil. The two sides are, thus, implacably opposed. • The archway's sturdy stone construction hides several hidden rooms and a narrow spiral staircase leading to a secret cellar. • Birds do not roost on the Nowhere Arch. • Option: Marsh Meadow lies beyond the Nowhere Arch.
9. THE OLD CHAPEL This rambling ruin clings to the side of a vertiginous bluff. Birds nest amid its crumbling remains, and the curious sometimes gaze up at the ruins and wonder what ancient rites and rituals were practised therein. • The Old Chapel has no sinister origin or purpose; it was raised by a wealthy widow who simply wished to pray in peace. With her demise, the funds for the chapel ceased to flow and the place was abandoned. • Lights occasionally burn and flicker amid the ruins. The homeless, or those in hiding, sometimes lurk within for a spell, but the lights give rise to all sorts of dark rumours. • Several faiths claim the ruined chapel as their own, and all seek to rebuild it. The matter has sparked considerable intrigue among the town's clergy. • Option: Combine the Old Chapel with the Lightness Burrow.
10. STATUE OF THE BABY EATER Centuries ago, the so-called Baby Eater terrorised the town. Wild legends blamed the killings on (variously) a demon released from a wizard's tower, a marauding evil spirit or foul ogre of inestimable cunning and impossibly hideous appearance able to cloak itself in invisibility. The killings went on for a decade until a local seer pronounced that the commissioning of a grand statue in the Baby Killer's honour would end the killings. This the townsfolk did, raising the requisite funds through a public subscription, and sure enough, the killings ceased. • The locals believe that if the statue is removed or destroyed, the killings will begin again. • Parents and parents-to-be often leave small sacrifices— coins, food, bunches of flowers and the like—at the statue's feet to keep their infants safe from the Baby Eater's attentions. • A child recently disappeared in the statue's environs, and consequently, a great profusion of small offerings and sacrifices litters the ground around the statue. Some people argue that recent offerings to the statue have not been generous enough which explains the recent disappearance—it is a warning.
11. TOWER OF EZEN-KAR The crooked nine-storey tower of Ezen-Kar pre-dates the town by centuries. Of an architectural style both singular and archaic the tower stands at the centre of innumerable rumours and legends. The tower's stonework is weatherworn, but traces of its original decorations—a great mass of interwoven, writhing snakes—remains visible to those closely examining its walls. • The tower was once the centre of an ancient snakeworshipping cult. • Deep crypts below the tower hold an uncountable horde of undead snakes. They lurk in the darkness, waiting for the time when their lord calls them forth to ravage the world of men. • Ezen-Kar, a wizard of great power but unknown origin, dwells in the tower. A seer, a sage and—allegedly—a peerless user of magic he (or perhaps she as the wizard's personal characteristics have been variously reported) sometimes receives guests. Not all leave. • Option: Combine the Tower of Ezen-Kar with the Lightness Burrow.
12. WRAGG' S QUARRY Extensive underground quarries lie below the poorer parts of town. The quarries comprise several large chambers and innumerable side workings, passageways and shafts. Much of Wragg's Quarry is partially flooded. • Sometimes, after heavy rain sinkholes open up and swallow whole houses. Because the quarry lies under the poorer sections of town, nothing has been done to make the place safe. • T h e h o m e l e s s h a v e colonised Wragg's Quarry. Some live in the upper, dry sections while others dwell on ramshackle rafts gently dr i f t i n g t h rough t h e flooded quarry's main workings. • Some locals use the smaller sinkholes above W r a g g ' s Q u a r r y a s somewhere to dump rubbish or to get water. The former practice makes the latter unwise. 





## MINOR URBAN LANDMARKS 



1. Plague Pit Lane: Fifty years ago, plague ravaged the community. With civil order breaking down, the plague's many victims were buried in a mass grave. The town has since expanded over the site.
2. The Goblin Hall: This vaulted L-shaped underground chamber is the only surviving remnant of a church that once stood on the site. The chamber was both a store and a sanctuary—a final redoubt in times of trouble.
3. Copse Hill: Thick stands of trees cluster atop Copse Hill. Sometimes, locals refer to the place as Corpse Hill in reference to long-standing rumours the hill is the burial mound of a long-dead forgotten king.
4. The Old Man: Immensely old and gnarled, this oak tree has stood for centuries. Locals love the tree and violently oppose any who seek it harm.
5. Setta's Cavern: This small cavern was discovered during the digging of a well. A capable climber can reach the cavern which has sporadically served as a home, shrine and hideout over the years. It is named for its longest inhabitant: a hermit who lived within for a decade.
6. The Church of Flowers: Decades ago, the church standing here burnt down. The clergy lacked the funds to rebuild the church, and the site was abandoned. A great swath of wildflowers took hold among the ruins in the years following the fire. Now locals come here to escape the hustle and bustle of urban life.
7. The Cat and Parrot: The Cat and Parrot was a local tavern until the owner sold up and moved away. The new owner transformed the tavern into a private home but left the giant mural of a cat creeping up on a parrot decorating the side of the building intact. Now peeling and weatherworn, the mural nevertheless remains a prominent local landmark.
8. Saint Dunstan's Stone: When Saint Dunstan visited the town, he is said to have used this stone to dismount from his horse. Since then, several miraculous events have been linked to this otherwise nondescript chunk of jagged rock. A black iron fence now surrounds the stone. Every holy day, believers come here to pray.
9. The Bronze Lions: These two ornate statues stand on either side of an archway leading into a small court. The statues are of lions sitting on their haunches and have stood here for years, as evidenced by their green patina. Local superstition has it that the statues contain the spirits of actual lions.
10. The Elaboratory: Smoke often billows from the halfdozen tall, slender chimneys of this stone and slate building. The same family has owned this building since they purchased and extensively renovated it a halfcentury ago. The family are widely seen as a little strange, but their alchemical abilities are undeniable.
11. Crossbones Pauper Cemetary: When the poor, the homeless or the criminal die, their remains end up in this small, overflowing graveyard. Such is the volume of remains interred within, the ground has risen six feet since the cemetery was established. A low wall—in danger of being overwhelmed—bounds the place.
12. The Golden Unicorn: This lifesized statue stands atop a wide plinth—inconveniently for carters and the like—at the junction of three roads. An eccentric retired adventurer peeved by the constant noisy traffic of carts and coaches outside his door erected the statue. His plan backfired spectacularly; local children love the statue, and they (noisily) climb on and play around the thing most days.
13. Three Arches: These three recessed archways once led to storage vaults buried in the side of a hill. Since the vaults were sealed, the recessed archways have become a favoured sheltered haunt for beggars.
14. Joot's Walk: Built by a wealthy merchant, for discrete access to his mistress's home, this shoulder-wide, winding alley only came to widespread knowledge when several nearby buildings were demolished. Now, it serves as a handy, quick cut-through—assuming no one is coming in the opposite direction.
15. The Spire: This slender spire of magically crafted black stone overlooks the town's main thoroughfare. The pitched-soaked heads of renowned criminals and traitors adorn the spire.
16. Mord's House: This is one of the oldest buildings in the town. Standing behind high smooth stone walls, it was built by a wizard who wanted privacy to continue his research. Persistent rumours tell of skeletons buried in the foundations and powerful magical defences. No one has been seen entering or exiting the grounds in years.
17. Ergil's Etchings: Over a decade or so, an unknown local artist produced a series of beautiful etchings and carvings commemorating notable events in the town's past. These decorate various prominent landmarks; how the artist managed this without being seen remains an occasional subject of lively debate.
18. The Iron Lady: This impressive, oversized iron statue of a noblewoman set atop a fluted granite base overlooks the marketplace. Depicting a particularly inflexible mayor of bygone times, the statue is subject to sporadic vandalism. Its exceptionally sturdy construction has thus far resisted all serious damage.
19. Sickwell: No one uses the so-called Sickwell now after several poisonings and deaths were traced to its waters. Sickwell stands close to Crossbones Pauper Cemetery. Locals believe the decomposing remains therein have contaminated the well's water.
20. Bearcock Square: This small court hosts dog, bear and cock fights on a nightly basis. Taverns, gambling dens and whorehouses front onto the square. Here, the worst of humanity is on display nightly. 





# URBAN ODDITIES 





## ODD, BUT FUN, FESTIVALS 



1. Cheese Racing: The village is well known for its cheese industry. To celebrate, the villagers practise cheese chasing in an annual race. They gather atop the nearest steepest hill every year, where the most prominent cheese producers unleash large, circular cheeses down the hill. The goal of the race is to get your cheese as far as possible down the hill without carrying it. Competing teams of farmers work together to protect their cheese from their rivals. Fistfights invariably ensue as scores of villagers charge after each cheese.
2. Witch Hunting: In the past, the village was beset by a coven of witches. After a reign of terror, the witches were caught and burnt at the stake. To celebrate their liberation, the villagers have a witch hunt every year. Four local women dress up as witches and hide in the village or its locality. The other villagers must find them. Afterwards, the villagers celebrate late into the night around a huge bonfire on which are burnt the effigies of the original four witches.
3. Dead Rising: Once a year, the villagers exhume the decaying bodies of the recently deceased and carry them through the streets in celebration of their lives. Afterwards, the dead villagers preside over a hearty feast eaten by the flickering flames of giant bonfires set about the village's bounds.
4. River Dunking: A river runs through or near the village. Every year, when the winter snows have melted, and the river is at its most swollen, the villagers gather at the river for a day-long tug of war competition. Rivalry among teams is fierce and—of course—there's lots of eating and drinking. Almost everyone is tired, cold, wet, drunk and happy by the end of the day.
5. Pig Racing: The villagers gather as part of the harvest festival to race their prize pigs. Farmers ride their favourite pigs through the streets in a mad race to the finish. The race is pure chaos and little more than a rough and muddy free-for-all. Although participants cannot carry weapons, injuries are common as goodnatured fistfights erupt along the course between riders (and sometimes spectators). There is no set prize for winning the race, except for the prestige of being the best rider with the best pig.
6. Barrel Burning: For this celebration, participants fill old barrels with tar and set them aflame. The competitors then carry the barrels as far as possible through the village while being cheered on by spectators. The winner is the person who carries their barrel furthest. Injuries are common in this bizarre practice, and the use of magic is frowned on (at least until the race is over). This race takes place at night and is a spectacular sight. Before, during and afterwards, there is much drinking and merriment.
7. Barrel Boating: The villagers take to their barrels and attempt to “sail” them down the river that runs through the settlement. Like pig racing (see #5), the race is wild and has few rules. Competitors work at capsizing or holing their rivals, and just finishing the race is seen as a major achievement. The first person to finish gets his barrel filled with ale by the local lord. Folk come from the surrounding villages to watch (and sometimes participate). Recent years have seen the introduction of a (slightly less violent) child's race.
8. Wife Stealing: This festival's roots go back hundreds of years to when the villagers raided other nearby settlements for womenfolk. In it, participants—or raiders— must carry a neighbour's wife over a set course comprising many obstacles. The “stolen” wives' husbands lurk on the course and try to recapture their wives. Of course, the competition is good-natured. If a raider gets to the end of the course with a stolen wife, he can claim a prize from the husband—usually a flagon of ale, handy tool or suchlike. Shockingly, afterwards, much drinking ensues.
9. Gods Awakening: In this once-yearly festival held at the winter solstice, the villagers light a massive bonfire on the highest hill near the village. Building the bonfire can take weeks. Once it is lit, the villagers sing songs of praise to their gods and pray for a year free of raiders and pestilence. During bad years, the villagers build massive fires hoping this will please the gods and return their favour to the village. Persistent rumours whisper that the villagers secretly practise human sacrifice; unfortunates are said to be tied to a stake in the middle of the bonfire and burnt alive as an offering.
10. Dance of the Dead: In this macabre celebration, held every year to mark the village's deliverance from a necromancer's undead army, the villagers dress as skeletons and zombies and dance through the streets in wild abandon. Some of the villagers' costumes are disturbingly realistic—comprised as they are of actual bones. The festival is held at night, and adventurers witnessing it without knowledge of the celebration's significance could be forgiven for thinking an evil cult is at work in the village. 





## ODD FEATURES & BUILDINGS 



1. The Needle: This slender pillar-like monument rises 40- foot into the sky and ends at a perfect point. Some locals call the bizarre column “The Giant's Spear”. Careful observation of the Needle reveals it leans slightly to the west. The Needle predates the surrounding settlement.
2. The Snake's Head: A weather-worn outcrop of rock almost 20-foot-high stands amid a small grove of trees. The stone has been partly carved to depict a great snake. The snake's head and part of its body blend seamlessly with the rock beneath. Unsurprisingly, many rumours hang over the stone, but its true origin and the identity of the ancient sculptor remain unknown.
3. The Great Ditch: In olden times, the settlement was often beset by marauding bandits and evil humanoids. The villagers excavated a huge ditch around the village to keep the raiders out. Over the years, it has become traditional for villagers guilty of minor crimes to continue excavations. Currently, the ditch is 15-foot-wide and up to 30-foot-deep. Most days, at least one villager can be seen toiling in its depths.
4. Demon Statues: Several of the village's houses have old statues incorporated into their outer walls. These statues uniformly depict terrifying and horrible demonic figures. Most of the statues' fine features have long since been chipped off or eroded by countless years of weather. The villagers have affectionate nicknames for all the figures and use them when giving directions to (invariably baffled) visitors.
5. Sir Ozloc's Folly: Sir Ozloc was an adventurer with a reputation for always surviving the most dangerous and difficult adventures through dint of his finely honed sense of impending danger and his much-practising sprinting skills. Sir Ozloc built this tall tower to keep watch for approaching threats. The folly is 80 feet high and commands excellent views over the surrounding land. Only one heavily fortified door leads into the interior, and local rumour has at least one escape tunnel leading away from the tower.
6. Crypt of Shadows: This macabre-sounding crypt is nothing more than the remains of an old church destroyed by fire decades ago. Seeing the fire as a mark of their god's displeasure with the church and its clergy, the villagers rebuilt their temple elsewhere. The old church's crypt survived the fire but has lain neglected and all but abandoned ever since. Sometimes children dare each other to creep within, or itinerant beggars use it as shelter during bad weather. No one believes the wild stories of hidden rooms, mass burials and a secret fane hidden below the crypt.
7. The Grey Man: The vast 100-foot-long outline of a naked man overlooks the village from a nearby hillside. The figure comprises hundreds of boulders, big and small, and required a tremendous amount of work to complete. Why this was done, and by who, is a mystery. In the spring and summer, flowers burst forth from among the boulders, giving the Grey Man a jaunty, cheery appearance in contrast to his dour and grey autumn and winter “look”.
8. Tree House: A huge oak tree grows through the roof of this otherwise typical house. The tree's wide canopy keeps the house in perpetual shadow. The house is the result of an old bet: the exact terms of the wager are lost to history and are the subject of good-natured drunken debate in the local tavern.
9. Bridge Homes: These tall, thin homes straddle a small river and result from an ancient legal ruling. The local lord's charter decrees that he owns all the lands surrounding his home but does not mention the rivers and streams (or their banks). Thus, enterprising villagers built their homes over the river to avoid buying or renting the land.
10. The Arches: Ten stone arches pierce the side of this flattopped hill. The arches are all that remains of a wizard's home that once stood atop this artificially extended mound. The Arches were built to widen the hill and provide space for a private raised garden. The wizard believed that certain exotic flowers, herbs and shrubs could be used in powders and pastes useful to his art. The house burnt down long ago, but parts of the garden survived. Some people believe the overgrown gardens hold plants given sentience b y t h e l a t e wizard. Most people avoid the place to be on the safe side. 





## ODD TRADITIONS 



1. The villagers—even the children—all wear jangling necklaces or bracelets. Some are made of bone, while others are of silver or even gold. The villagers believe the jangling keeps evil spirits away. All the houses also have wind chines (for the same reason).
2. No children are allowed out after dark without an adult. The villagers will not speak of the reason for this, but if a child does go out alone after sunset, panic ensues.
3. The local tavern serves an array of fine ales. Each of the regulars has their own named flagon—each with a flip-up lid to keep out flies, dust and suchlike. Some are ornate works of art passed down through the generations. Travellers must make do with an array of battered and cheap normal flagons.
4. The village has a vast population of cats; every family seems to have at least three or four such pets. Consequently, there are no vermin whatsoever in the village. It is illegal to harm a cat in the village. Those doing so much apologise to both the owner and the cat!
5. When one of their fellows dies, the villagers have a unique set of burial rites. The deceased is laid out amid the menhirs of a nearby stone circle for the birds and other predators. Once the skeleton is picked clean, the bones are collected and placed in the subterranean ossuary below the village church. Each family uses their ancestors' skeletons to create amazing but macabre sculptures out of nothing but bone. Many of these sculptures have been generations in the making.
6. No one may wear the colour red within the village's precincts by order of a long-dead lord. Some villagers may inform on characters wearing the dreaded colour, while others may breathlessly make the characters aware of their terrible error.
7. A decade ago, a fire devastated the village. The villagers have an inordinate fear of such an event occurring again. Horse troughs full of water stand in front of every house, and buckets are close at hand. In the same way, as the village has a local militia, it also has a fire brigade of sorts. They run weekly practises, one of which just happens to be in progress when the characters arrive at the village. The sight of a dozen villagers throwing buckets of water at a house that is not actually on fire may cause the characters to wonder if the villagers are entirely sane.
8. The villagers are friendly—nauseatingly so—toward adventurers. Nothing is too much trouble for such “honoured” visitors. The characters receive better service than the locals in any village businesses, and unattached villagers literally throw themselves at eligible adventurers in the party.
9. The villagers hate members of a certain race—halfling, elf, dwarf or gnome—and want nothing to do with such individuals. Bizarrely, they are overly friendly towards the members of another race and treat such folk as honoured guests for whom nothing is too much trouble.
10. The village has a local currency, and villagers do not accept payment in any other form. The coins they use come from an ancient hoard discovered on the land when the local lord built his manor or castle. If the party want to buy anything in the village—even a drink at the tavern—they must get some of the local currency from the lord's representative. Unsurprisingly, the exchange rate is not good…
11. Local decree prohibits anyone from riding animals within the village's precincts during daylight hours.
12. Each family is responsible for keeping the road directly outside their house clear of obstruction or hindrance. Thus stretches of road are clear of all obstructions— including dung—while others are in a much worse state.
13. Births are a time of great joy in the village. When one occurs, a festival-like atmosphere reigns; there is much drinking and carousing (which inevitably leads to more celebrations roughly nine months later).
14. Each family maintains a small, private burial ground on their land—normally in a corner of their field or garden. There is no communal cemetery, and strangers cannot be buried within the village's bounds.
15. Every family must keep a candle burning in a window overlooking the nearest road at night. Thus, those out after dark can always find their way home.
16. The local farmers highly prize dung because the surrounding land is hard to farm. Thus, several thriving local businesses have sprung up. These businesses “harvest” local “deposits" and import dung from nearby settlements. Even individuals and families sometimes sell their “excess."
17. The locals believe a nature spirit dwells in the nearby river. Although it teams with fish, no one dares fish there in case they anger the river's protector. Those caught fishing are severely punished.
18. No matter the weather, it is customary for adults to wear a hat outside. This has inevitably led to subtle (and not so subtle) one-upmanship and competitions for the greatest, most elaborate designs.
19. Children and small people such as dwarves and gnomes may not wear hats, except for one day a week.
20. When it rains, the villagers engage in “sky washing”. Nude villagers dash about, dance and sing joyous thanks to the nature god when it rains. 











## ODD LAWS 



1. It is forbidden to wear blue in public during daylight hours. At night, no such restriction exists.
2. It is illegal to die on the streets. Anyone doing so is prosecuted, and if found guilty, their family must pay a hefty fine.
3. The locals are exceptionally religious. Three times a day, the populace must pray at the nearest church. Failure to do so leads to a fine.
4. It is legal to shoot a half-orc with a crossbow within the village only if the half-orc is judged to be acting aggressively by three witnesses.
5. Silence is golden. The local lord requires his subjects to be well-rested. Singing and the playing of music are forbidden between dusk and dawn.
6. Every local is responsible for the stretch of road outside their house. They must keep it clean, tidy and in good repair. Thus, most homes are narrow and either very long or very tall. There are also few proper roads in the village, but a confusing array of footpaths, cut-throughs and the like.
7. Livestock and horses are not permitted to foul the streets. Owners are responsible for their animals' excrement. If the owner does not clean up after their animals, onlookers are legally entitled to pelt them with any unclaimed dung.
8. It is illegal to sing profane songs or rhymes in the street. The local clergy decide what is and isn't profane and keep any fines they levy. Consequently, there is not much singing in the village.
9. It is illegal to be drunk in charge of sheep within the settlement. The law was enacted years ago after an infamous event that locals refer to but do not describe.
10. Locals may take two fish from the local river a day but may not handle fish “in a suspicious fashion” near or on the river. (This law was enacted to stop the river from over-fishing after a druid threatened to curse the village and its lord).
11. Tavern landlords and innkeepers must not allow their customers to get drunk on the premises, and they cannot serve drunk customers in their establishments. Most landlords ignore this rule, and the local watch does not enforce it—except in extreme circumstances—in case a riot breaks out.
12. The local carters were a powerful faction in society. They paid the local lord to enact a law that states it is illegal to carry anything through town that requires more than one man to carry. In this way, they intended to make extra money transporting and delivering goods, but their plan backfired when an all-women porters guild sprung up and stole much of their supposed extra business.
13. It is illegal to knock on someone's front door and then leave before they answer it. (This means, in theory, that if no one were home, the visitor would have to wait until someone returned).
14. If you come to town while suffering from a disease, you must immediately visit a local church to declare your ailment to the clergy.
15. It is illegal to enter any church while wearing armour, but it is not illegal to wear armour while in a church.
16. Every adult must carry a sharp dagger or knife with them at all times. Sometimes, the lord's representatives carry out spot checks—mainly so they can levy a fine.
17. Men must secure permission from the local lord if they wish to wear a “head covering” in town. Women must likewise secure permission from the lord's wife. (The lord enacted this law to increase tax revenues and was deliberately vague with the phrase “head covering” which he interprets to include all hats and helmets along with any article of clothing which has a hood—whether or not the hood is actually covering the wearer's head).
18. Without special permission from the church, it is illegal to marry a dead person.
19. It is illegal to tell anyone about your dreams, but it is not illegal to relate your nightmares.
20. An animal may not be in charge of a horse and cart in the village. (The village had bad experiences with drunk druids and a legendarily irritating ranger who once dwelled in the locality.) 

## ODD PUNISHMENTS 



1. The guilty person must follow the whims and dictates of a randomly determined child.
2. The guilty person must dig a ditch.
3. The guilty person must stand watch at night.
4. The guilty person must run around the village while being pelted with rotten fruit, excrement and so on.
5. The guilty person must explain their crime and seek forgiveness from everyone they meet.
6. The guilty person must sit in a barrel filled with cold water while being pelted with dead fish.
7. The guilty person can only wear white clothes and shoes. If they have no such items, they must go about naked.
8. The guilty person must drink enough alcohol to render them unconscious—repeatedly. They then have their head and eyebrows shaved off. 





# VAMPIRE' S CASTLE 


## OUTSIDE THE VAMPIRE' S CASTLE 



1. The land surrounding the castle is a bleak place; plants appear warped and stunted, and there is an obvious lack of wildlife. Elves, druids and rangers automatically sense the oddness and imbalance of the locality.
2. A huge ghost-white owl perches high up in the leafless branches of a gnarled oak tree. It stares unblinkingly at the party before silently taking flight.
3. The decomposing corpse of a peasant slumps against a tree's gnarled trunk. The unfortunate appears to be the victim of a frenzied attack—his body has literally been ripped apart by a creature of great strength.
4. Black clouds hang over the castle and its surrounds, throwing the whole place into deep gloom. Under the cloud, the wind doesn't blow, and only the faintest breeze disturbs the tree's leafless branches. It is surprisingly cold in the castle's immediate environs.
5. The road leading to the castle is overgrown. Thick weeds and noisome bramble bushes cluster thickly against the trail. A character well-versed in tracking can easily determine this road does not see much traffic—which is surprising as the castle's occupants must require frequent deliveries of supplies and the like.
6. Observant characters note a strange characteristic of the trees and shrubs growing near the castle. The branches and leaves growing on the side closest to the castle are shrivelled and discoloured, while those growing on their other sides are comparatively normal (if unhealthy).
7. The mouldering corpse of a hanged man dangles from a stout tree branch. The rope creaks as the corpse sways slowly in the breeze. A crude sign hangs around the man's neck; it reads, “Consort of Fiends”.
8. Light fog perpetually cloaks the ground surrounding the castle. The fog always seems to grow thicker at night, blanketing the castle in a white, wet blanket. The fog deadens sounds and moves and twists in bizarre and disturbing ways. Only the midday sun is strong enough to burn away the night's accumulation of fog.
9. Thick fields of gluttonous mud extend away from the castle in all directions. The remains of dry stone walls, mud-filled ditches and the like show where farming was once practised. Clearly, no crops have been grown here for years.
10. The white bones of a large horse—perhaps even a warhorse—lie sprawled in the undergrowth by the road amid rotting scraps of its bit, bridle and saddle. Thick growths of weeds and brambles curl upwards and through the skeletal remains.
11. The castle throws deep, strangely elongated shadows over the surroundings. Some of the shadows form disturbing shapes which bear no resemblance to the castle's outline.
12. A gigantic stone pillar looms over the road. Carved into a bewildering array of twisted, horrible shapes the column's centrepiece is a carven image of the vampire's heraldic device. No weeds, brambles or briars grow near the pillar—it is a hateful thing. 





## INSIDE THE VAMPIRE' S CASTLE 



### PRESENTABLE LOCATIONS 



1. A thick, faded rug covers the floor. Wear marks on the rug show this to be a high-traffic area. Characters looking under the rug discover a large, dried bloodstain.
2. A lone bat roosts high up in a dark corner of the passageway or chamber. Light—such as that thrown by a torch or light spell startles the bat; it flutters madly around the area for a few seconds before darting out the nearest window or arrow slit.
3. Perceptive characters notice a faint imprint of a bloody palm print near a window. Characters investigating this discovery realise the bloodstain was left by someone climbing into the room from outside.
4. The portraits hanging on the walls are old and faded. The folk in the pictures wear grim looks on their faces. Cobwebs cluster thickly about the portraits' frames. No obviously new portraits hang on the walls.
5. After spending some time exploring the castle, a perceptive character notices the complete lack of religious paraphernalia or mirrors in any of the castle's public areas. The castle's chapel is dusty and unused.
6. At night, the castle's interior is poorly lit. Many of the castle's torch sconces are empty, and those actually equipped with torches invariably gutter out during the night. Thus, deep pools of darkness fill many of the castle's passageways, staircases and chambers—a perfect hunting ground for a hungry vampire.
7. The doors warding many of the castle's guest chambers are equipped with comparatively new and complex locks. Strangely, most of the locks have no keys in them. A close examination of these locks reveals a hidden mechanism on the outside of the door that unlocks the doors without the need for a key.
8. The castle is seemingly free of vermin; the rats normally present in such locales are nowhere to be seen (the vampire uses his powers to keep them in check). The castle also has no cats or dogs.
9. Dusty, once fine, tapestries hang on the walls. Each depicts a key scene in the family's history—the first of the family line being ennobled, a heroic victory in battle and the like.
10. A dark, shadow-filled alcove holds a dusty display of a suit of plate armour along with several weapons including a spear, morningstar and longsword. The armour clutches the spear while the other two weapons are pinned to the wall. Paranoid characters may suspect the armour and weapons to be animate guardians…and they very well might be! 

### GORE-SPLATTERED LOCATIONS 



1. The pallid, bloodless corpse of a naked human man lies sprawled on the floor. Although the corpse is partially decomposed, a score or more bite marks are evident all over the body.
2. An impressive spray of dried arterial blood decorates one wall and ceiling. Characters investigating the spray notice disturbing marks in the dried blood that suggest someone—or something—licked some of the blood up.
3. A ripped and smashed picture hangs drunkenly on the wall, its frame splintered. The picture's remains depict the vampire as it was in life.
4. Graffiti scratched into the floor (perhaps with a dagger or similar) reads, “Despair. The castle's master is a devil.”
5. Jagged fragments of a wooden stake lie scattered about the floor. Dried blood coats the stake's tip.
6. The skeletal remains of some unfortunate lies heaped in a corner. A character wise in the healing arts who examines the remains notices deep gouge marks on some of the person's neck bones.
7. A twisted, partially crushed silver holy symbol of a goodaligned faith lies on the floor against a wall. A chip in the stone above suggests it was hurled against the wall with considerable force.
8. Chilly, brooding darkness fills this area. Sensitive (or paranoid) characters detect a sense of lurking, malignant menace in the dark. Investigation suggests the cold air seems to be issuing upwards through many small cracks in the floor.
9. Dust cloaks the floor and cobwebs hang from the ceiling so low they brush over the faces of those exploring the area. Careful searching reveals the faint outlines of tracks in the dust created by someone running. It is impossible to tell how long ago the tracks were made.
10. A gentle breeze—perhaps from a cracked window or arrow slit—occasionally blows through this area stirring up the dust herein into short-lived dust devils. (This could work in the party's favour as the dancing dust might reveal a hiding or invisible enemy just before it strikes or could obscure their footprints). 





## THE VAMPIRE' S SERVANTS 



1. ARIQUIS GAROTHYN NE male half-elf fighter 2/thief 2 Ruggedly handsome in a rough sort of way, this black-haired half-elf carries himself with vigour and confidence. Ariquis willingly serves his master and carries out all manner of depravities and the like in his name. One of the vampire's most trusted (and presentable) servants Ariquis often wanders the surrounding countryside or visits nearby towns and villages in search of victims for his master. Personality: Depraved and lecherous before he fell under the vampire's influence Ariquis exults in indulging his darkest fantasies on those falling into his clutches. He is also a bully and terrifies his victims with descriptions of what his master will do to them. Mannerisms: Ariquis has an unsettling steady stare; he doesn't blink—ever. Unique Treasures: Ariquis loves taking small trinkets from his victims. Most such objects are nearly worthless rings, earrings and the like. One chunky golden ring in his possession, however, has a hinged compartment that can hold a powder or poison. Hook: In defeat, Ariquis is pathetic. If badly injured, he throws himself to the floor and begs for mercy. He spins a tale of the vampire corrupting him and (again) begs for a second chance. He is lying and reverts to his old self—or attempts to escape—at the earliest opportunity.
2. CALADAL NACKLE CN (NE) old female gnome With an expression veering between exhausted and petrified this tiny old gnomish woman seems on the verge of collapse. Caladal has served the vampire for decades—perhaps even a century or more; she's not sure anymore as the long days and longer nights have blurred into one. She accepts her lot and knows she will soon die—it is only a matter of time before her master, or one of his favoured servants, ends her miserable existence; she just hopes she does not join the undead's ranks. Personality: Utterly terrified by her master Caladal's spirit has been crushed through long decades of service. Once a wild spirit, she has been broken and has begun to slide into evil and extreme selfishness. She just wants to survive as long as possible and will sacrifice anything (and anyone) to achieve her goal. Mannerisms: Sudden movements terrify Caladal, and she cowers away from them. She often sighs deeply. Unique Treasures: Caladal has collected an amazing array of odds and ends during her long service. Before she lost her hope, she even stole several silver vials each holding precious holy water from the vampire's various victims. Hook: Caladal sees the characters as her possible salvation. Too scared to move openly against her lord, she surreptitiously helps intruders—perhaps by leaving one of her precious vials of holy water where they will find it.
3. HENK CE male half-orc thief 4 Mostly bald and shockingly ugly this chubby half-orc has a look of dim-witted ignorance about his piggy face. Henk loves serving his master because sometimes he gets to indulge his most deviant passion—cannibalism. Once his master has finished with his victims, Henk drags the corpse away to feast on its juicy, tender flesh. Personality: Utterly without morals, a sense of mercy or any real empathy Henk is a perfect servant for the vampire. Mannerisms: When looking at a living person, Henk often can't help licking his lips in a very suggestive, perhaps disturbing, fashion. Perceptive observers may note he's filed his teeth into particularly sharp points. Unique Treasures: Henk has collected many overlooked trinkets from his countless victims. If the characters are looking for a particular person, chances are Henk possesses a distinct piece of jewellery that hints at their fate. In particular, he possesses several golden picture lockets which hold tiny portraits of their previous owners' loved ones. Hook: Most odious of the vampire's servants, Henk's chambers are a charnel house. Characters reaching his rooms will be under no illusions as to the depths of his depravities. Henk doesn't see what's wrong with his practises —his meals were dead, after all, by the time he got to them. 





## THE VAMPIRE' S “GUESTS" 



1. HANNU ESKOLA LN middle-aged male human Tall, slender, and partially bald this stooped man keeps his gaze downcast toward the floor. Hannu came to the castle to investigate a debt owed to his master by one of the castle's occupants (perhaps even the vampire itself). He's convinced it's the worst thing he has ever done and is desperate to escape. Personality: Terrified and desperate to escape, Hannu latches onto anyone who seems to know what they are doing. He dreams of returning to his beloved home, and never leaving again. Mannerisms: Hannu stutters and has recently developed an inability to look anyone in the eye. Unique Treasures: Although he has lost most of his possessions, Hannu has managed to hide a small leather folder in his chamber which contains a summary and legal document setting out the debt owed to his master. This might include details of the debt's forfeiture clause—perhaps even a transfer of the castle's deeds! Hook: Hannu offers to introduce the characters to his master and to give a favourable account of their exploits if they free him from the castle. His patron could be the source of future quests for the party.
2. MIKKO LEINO CN male human fighter 2 Clad in a rusty, battered suit of chainmail this tall, wiry man has the look of a caged wolf about him. Mikko strayed too close to the castle with his bandit fellows. In the desperate fight that followed, his companions were slaughtered, but he was spared for some unknown reason. Personality: Outwardly brash, brave and full of youth's bravado Mikko talks much about what he'll do to his jailer if the vampire ever falls into his clutches. In truth, Mikko is an excellent actor and realises he is doomed unless he can escape. Not big on preparation, “We rush in and slay them all” is the height of his tactical thinking. Mannerisms: Mikko talks loudly, but does not have an extensive vocabulary. He uses only short, simple words and grows angry if he does not understand what other people are on about. Unique Treasures: Mikko knows the location of the bandits' buried treasure hoard (such as it is) and offers to share it with the characters if they help him escape. He overstates the value of the hoard to entice the characters into helping him. Hook: Although outwardly brash and confident, Mikko craves a guide and mentor. He latches onto the most charismatic warrior-type in the group and positions himself as that person's loyal retainer.
3. SONJA KETO LG female human cleric 1 Beautiful, but with a haunted, worried look, this woman wears grubby, blood-spattered priestly vestments. Sonja has been at the castle for six months. The vampire has discovered her blood is the best he has ever tasted—thus, he keeps Sonja around in the same way a wine collector carefully stores a fine vintage. Personality: Friendly, but obviously nervous (or perhaps hiding something), Sonja is traumatised by her experiences in the castle. She has developed a deep distrust of anyone she meets and constantly worries about the vampire's unnaturally deep connection with her. Mannerisms: Sonja's body language screams of her defensive attitude. She often seems on the verge of flight. She avoids areas of shadow wherever possible. Darkness terrifies her and she is never without a lit lantern or candle. Unique Treasures: Strangely, the vampire has permitted Sonja to keep her silver symbol but has forced her to scratch his name on the back. Hook: Because he loves the taste of her blood so much, the vampire takes extraordinary steps to keep Sonja safe and in his clutches. Paranoid or suspicious characters may suspect some other motivation guides the vampire's actions. 





## TREASURES, TRINKETS & TRASH 


### TREASURES 



1. This beautiful gold, gem-encrusted holy symbol hangs by a silver chain from a dusty, empty torch sconce. If the party carry lights, the gems glimmer at their approach; otherwise, only perceptive characters notice this treasure. The holy symbol is worth 100 gp.
2. A skeletal hand lies behind a piece of furniture. Two gold rings yet encircle two of its fingers. Each ring is worth 20 gp and bears a noble family's heraldic device.
3. Of cut crystal, this wine decanter stands next to two delicate matching wine glasses. The decanter, and one of the wine glasses, have a suspicious reddish-brown stain. The remains of another broken wine glass lie nearby. The set is worth 50 gp.
4. This black fur cloak is luscious, thick and warm. The pelt of a gigantic wolf, the cloak is a thing of rare craftsmanship. It is worth 150 gp, and of high enough quality to be used in the crafting of a magical item.
5. This beautifully wrought golden quill has a special fitting that allows new nibs to be inserted. It is worth 75 gp.
6. A small black velvet bag contains a silver brush and comb set suitable for use by a noblewoman. The set is worth 25 gp.
7. This crystal vial blown into the shape of a rearing unicorn is half full with expensive perfume. It is worth 20 gp.
8. The engraving of a beautiful elfin woman—a siren— decorates this platinum whistle that hangs from a plain leather thong.
9. This beautiful silver dagger has a red ruby set in its pommel and nestles in a beautifully soft leather scabbard. An outline of the dagger is stitched into the sheath in red thread. As a set, the dagger and scabbard are worth 600 gp.
10. A bag contains worn golden coins. Each coin has the vampire's family crest on one side and a stylised engraving of the castle on the other. 

### TRINKETS 



1. Crushed and broken, this fragment of a silver holy symbol once represented a blazing sun. Its remnant is worth 5 gp as scrap metal.
2. This ornate hooded lantern is shaped like a perched owl —its wings can be opened to reveal the light inside. The lantern is a bit battered but otherwise serviceable.
3. A fragment of delicate silver chain—the remains of a necklace—is tarnished and dirty. It is worth 4 gp.
4. A broken brass magnifying glass lies amid the shards of its lens. The remains are worth 2 gp.
5. A scrap of water-damaged map reveals some of the details of the area surrounding the castle. The map was accurate, but might be out of date.
6. The torn remnant of a bloodstained white silk robe flutters gently in the breeze. Paranoid characters might think it is a ghost or spectre.
7. An ornate cast-iron key lies discarded on the floor. Judging by its size, it opens a chest or strongbox.
8. A dusty circle—perhaps a protective circle—of silver coins decorates the floor. Another two silver coins are balanced on the next door handle the characters find.
9. A damaged silver pendant shaped like three arrows hangs from a torn leather thing.
10. The remains of a thieves' kit are scattered about the area. 

### TRASH 



1. Wooden fragments of a plain holy symbol litter the floor.
2. This empty potion vial is partially crushed as if someone had stood on it. The nearby floor is slightly discoloured.
3. The hilt of a dagger lies on the floor. Nearby a few shards of silver litter the floor.
4. A broken wine bottle—its label hopelessly faded—lies on the floor. Shards of brown glass lie scattered about the surrounding floor; some have been crushed underfoot and are little more than splinters of glass.
5. A bent crowbar lies on the floor in front of a door. Examination reveals pry marks around the door's lock.
6. A few wind-blown leaves lie in front of an open or broken window. Mottled brownish-green mould grows on the leaves and has begun to colonise the nearby floor and wall.
7. A badly dented hammer lies next to the jagged shard of a broken sword blade.
8. An arrow juts from a window frame. It looks like whoever shot the arrow was shooting at something climbing through the window. (This might be a helpful clue if the characters have not realised a vampire is in residence).
9. Drips of wax mar the floor. A perceptive character—or someone good at tracking—can follow the wax drips, which might lead to a secret compartment, hitherto unexplored part of the castle or similar. Small drops of dried blood lie next to some of the dripped wax.
10. An improvised wooden stake—clearly once a table leg— lies against one wall. A bloody handprint mars one end of the stake; the other is free of any such stain. 





# WAR-RAVAGED LAND 



## BATTLEFIELD DRESSING 



1. A corpse—festooned with arrows—lies sprawled on the ground. Almost a score of arrows pierce the unfortunate's body, although strangely, his face is unblemished. Nearby, lies the warrior's small, much dented, iron shield.
2. Here lies a great tangled heap of bodies surrounding a champion's hacked and mutilated body. Blood soaks the ground, and body parts lie scattered about. The enemy champion has been comprehensively looted—of his no doubt fine weapons and armour there is no sign.
3. Crows feast upon the bodies of the fallen in this part of the battlefield. The birds peck and tear at the dead; blood stains their feathers and beaks, giving them a somewhat infernal appearance. Unconcerned by folk moving among the dead, they only take flight if attacked or assailed by a loud noise.
4. A ragged, blood-splattered standard yet stands (at a somewhat drunken angle) among the carnage. The fighting was particularly savage here; piles of bodies lie scattered about. Macabrely, a severed hand yet clings to the banner.
5. Blood from the dead and the dying has flowed and oozed into this small hollow, which is now filled with a veritable pool of congealing blood. A stray dog laps at the blood, seemingly unaware of the surrounding butchery and slaughter.
6. Freshly turned earth—a crude grave—stands amid the slaughter atop a slight rise. A broken sword is thrust into the ground at the head of the grave to serve as a grave marker; a helmet hangs from the sword's pommel.
7. A low moaning emanates from beneath a pile of bodies. Investigation reveals a critically injured warrior mere moments from death. The warrior, who bleeds profusely, has suffered several deep scalp wounds and one of his eyes has been destroyed.
8. A heap of broken equipment shows where the victors have begun gathering up the leavings of the slaughter. Hacked suits of armour, splintered shields, broken weapons and so on all lie here in a pile.
9. A horse—several deep slashes on one of its flanks— wanders among the carnage. Wearing slashed and torn leather barding, the beast is a warhorse—breed to fight. It is skittish and exhausted; the characters must earn its trust before it allows them to approach.
10. A small heap of bodies is the beginning of what was destined to be a funeral pyre. Nearby lies a salvaged pile of useable equipment, weapons and armour. Slightly further away lies a pile of broken equipment. 





## SIGNS OF WAR 



1. A smudge of smoke mars the horizon. Characters with sharp eyesight notice the smudge comprises a halfdozen or so intertwined pillars of smoke. Perhaps, a hamlet burns.
2. A towering pillar of black, churning smoke rises high into the sky. From the amount of smoke, an entire village must be on fire.
3. A great swath of churned mud cuts across the characters' path. Even those without any tracking skills can see a large band of warriors—many heavily laden— passed this way recently.
4. A recently raised stone cairn stands atop a low hill. A ragged, bloody banner hanging from a pole thrust deep into the cairn stirs listlessly in the faint breeze. The cairn is large—15-foot wide, 30-foot long and 15-foot high; many bodies probably lie within.
5. The remains of a funeral pyre smoulder amid a wide circle of burnt and scorched vegetation. Wisps of smoke rise from the chunks of charred wood, smouldering ash and scorched bones comprising the pyre's remains. Before setting the pyre, the victors looted the bodies of the fallen; there is no treasure here.
6. The bloody leavings of a minor skirmish covers the ground. Here, the hacked and broken bodies of the fallen lie amid a welter of blood, body parts and broken equipment. The party's arrival scatters a dozen or so birds and an emaciated dog that were feeding on the dead. The victors looted the dead, and little—if anything— of value remains.
7. A red tinge to its waters gives this narrow river a macabre appearance. Moments after the characters arrive on its banks, the bodies of a half-dozen or so individuals bob past in the current. One becomes stuck in the reeds growing thickly along this stretch of river.
8. Two warriors hang from nooses of crude hemp rope thrown over the branch of a large oak tree. Each bears a hastily scrawled sign on their chest that reads, “Deserter”.
9. An overturned cart lies in a ditch by the side of the road. Pinned below it lies a dead, mouldering horse. The cart has been comprehensively looted. Of the owner, there is no sign. Tracks in the surroundings suggest an ambush took place here.
10. The characters discover the leavings of an impromptu campsite. Obvious signs, including a half-dozen cold campfires, a noisome latrine pit and general rubbish, point to many individuals resting here overnight. Three shallow graves lie nearby in the lee of a small hill. 





## SIGHTS IN A WAR-RAVAGED VILLAGE 



1. Fallen from a nearby building, a pile of tumbled, burnt timbers partly blocks the street. The slashed and burnt corpse of a horse lies nearby. The smell of smoke and burnt flesh is heavy in the air.
2. A body lies in the street, several arrows protruding from its chest. A crow perches atop the body, pecking at the unfortunate's face. If disturbed, it caws indignantly and flies away.
3. Smoke rises from a chimney. Investigation reveals a smouldering fire and a pot of burnt stew. A cursory search of the house shows signs of a hasty departure.
4. Several corpses lie entwined in the street. A skirmish was fought here—a skirmish the villagers clearly lost as none of the intruders' bodies lie among the fallen.
5. An overturned cart, festooned with arrows, partially blocks the street. The bodies of three villagers lie behind the cart. Their weapons—two spears and a shortbow along with an empty quiver—lie nearby.
6. A gaunt dog darts across the street ahead of the party. (Perceptive characters notice a wound on his left hind leg). At the sight of the adventurers, it flees into a nearby building and hides. A ranger, druid or similarly skilled character may be able to coax the dog forth. Anyone being particularly kind to the dog gains a friend for life.
7. This house has collapsed in on itself; a few charred timbers and the chimney remain upright. Parts of the ruin still smoulder. Character sifting through the house's remains finds nothing interesting except a partially squashed cooking pot and a child's scorched skeleton.
8. Three crows perch on a fence and stare hungrily at the bodies lying scattered about. Unless the characters shoo them away, they soon fly down to feed.
9. A loud crash from deeper into the village heralds the collapse of a damaged building. Startled, birds perching about the ruins take wing and fly away.
10. A cauldron, several pewter goblets and some other odds and ends are scattered on the ground outside a ransacked house. The house's door gapes wide; no sound emanates from within.
11. A black cat slinks across the road, clutching something bloody in its jaws. At the sight of the characters, it darts away with its prize.
12. A pool of congealing blood decorates the ground. Enough blood has been shed here that whatever was injured probably died of its wounds. However, there is no sign of a body.
13. Driven by faint gusts of wind, ash swirls across the street. It seems to dance about the party before settling to the ground like grey snow.
14. Several bodies lie scattered on the ground. Perceptive characters hear a faint mewling coming from the body of a young woman. A baby, wrapped tight in a bloodstained blanket, lies under its mother's body. The baby is dehydrated and hungry but uninjured.
15. The slashed and stabbed corpses of three villagers hang upside down from the boughs of a large tree. Crows feast on their mutilated bodies. It seems the doomed souls were hung before being used as practise targets.
16. This house seems to have been the site of greater than normal resistance. Two raiders lie dead at the front door, and a half-dozen or so arrows yet jut from its window and door frames. Inside, chaos and destruction greet explorers. Two more raiders lie dead within, but there is no sign of the defenders.
17. The mournful tinkle of wind chimes reaches the party's ears. Characters following the sound discover the chimes hanging from the eves of the village tavern. Opened, empty barrels and casks lie about; clearly, the raiders slaked their thirst here.
18. A red cloak lies discarded in the street. As the characters approach, the wind plucks at its hem but does not blow it away. A dozen gold coins are sewn into the cloak's lining, but only perceptive characters searching the cloak find them.
19. Smoke rises from this building; its old thatch was sodden, and it has only just caught fire. The thatch will smoulder for another hour before the roof collapses.
20. A lone horse—a long slash across its face—plods through the village. It wears saddle and bridle. Blood splatters the saddle and the horse's back suggesting the rider's fate was not a pleasant one. 





## THINGS TO SEE DURING A SIEGE 



1. A servant rushes passed. He bears a wooden pole over his shoulders from which hang two buckets filled with water. Several pewter drinking cups also hang from the pole. As he hurries off, he slops water onto the floor.
2. A guard atop the wall leans against the parapet looking out over the battlements. (A perceptive character notices the guard does not move; he could be asleep or dead— the victim of a spy or assassin creeping over the wall).
3. Two guards huddle behind the battlements, deep in conversation. They seem to be paying almost no attention to the enemy.
4. Two children sit huddled against a wall. Wrapped in cutdown thick cloaks, they sob quietly. Nearby squats a worried-looking man clad in ragged leather armour. He clutches a spear and has a grim look of determination on his face.
5. The jingle of armour and the tread of heavy feet heralds the approach of a four-man patrol of men-at-arms. (A perceptive character notices the men-at-arms have worried looks on their faces). Before continuing their patrol, they search any obvious hiding places in the immediate vicinity.
6. The sudden harsh clamour of blade on blade nearby shatters the relative peace. (Investigations reveal two men-at-arms practising their swordplay—enemies are not within the walls).
7. A sudden wind picks up, blowing the stench of the enemies' camp over the fortress' walls. Snatches of sound also reach the defenders' ears.
8. Suddenly an arrow arcs over the wall. It narrowly misses a man-at-arms, who instinctively ducks as it shatters against a nearby wall.
9. A small group of peasants stand in a loose circle. An angry murmur rises above the group as one of the burlier men expounds upon some point. A single alert, man-at-arms, stands nearby observing the group with a concerned look upon his face. Several of the women in the group cast dark looks in his direction.
10. With a scream, one of the guards atop the wall suddenly throws his hands into the air before falling backwards off the walkway, an arrow in his throat. (Characters rushing to his aid discover he is already dead).
11. A young teenage boy wearing a rusting suit of chainmail and a comically oversized helmet staggers past. He nervously clutches a spear and looks terrified.
12. Suddenly, a wildly struck alarm bell shatters the relative calm. Immediately, defenders grab their weapons and rush to man the walls. (This could be a false alarm or the start of a proper attack).
13. Deep drumming sounds from somewhere in the enemy camp. It begins suddenly and goes on for hours.
14. Heavy rain lashes both attackers and defenders. Visibility is reduced, and the ground outside the wall quickly turns to mud. Whoever can do so seeks shelter. The rain lasts for several hours before slowly petering out.
15. A large bird circles high above the walls. Several defenders mutter among themselves, and some shoot at the bird, but to no avail. (Perceptive characters even note one of the shots seems to hit the bird but bounces off!)
16. Tears running down his face, a small child wanders about. He has lost his mother and cannot find her. If he— Aldorn—is returned to his mother—Shel—she is tremendously grateful as he has been missing for hours. (Later, if the enemy breaches the walls, Shel seeks the party out for protection; Aldorn—at an impressionable age—begins to hero-worship one of the characters).
17. Hysterical screaming alerts everyone nearby to a terrible event. Investigations reveal a man-at-arms dead with a dagger in his back. Was the death the result of an argument, or has a spy snuck into the fortress?
18. A commotion without the walls reveals the arrival of reinforcements to bolster the attackers. Several covered wagons hint at the arrival of extra supplies—or perhaps even a dismantled siege engine (and its ammunition).
19. A man-at-arms, clearly drunk almost beyond words—lies slumped against a wall. The man is insensible; he is found by an officer and hauled away. The next day, he is hung from the walls as an example to others.
20. The enemy camp is suspiciously quiet all day. Suspicions rise that they are planning a major attack. 





## SIGHTS DURING A VILLAGE RAID 



1. A small, snivelling child huddles behind a barrel, trying to hide from the rampaging orcs.
2. Fire suddenly takes hold of a nearby building, and smoke from its burning thatch fills the air. Indistinct screaming comes from within...
3. Shouts, screams and the sound of battle fill the air. One deafening, piercing scream ends suddenly.
4. A mother dashes across the street, dragging one child behind her. In her other hand, she carries an old spear.
5. The sprawled and bloody corpse of a militia member lies in the street. He has been hacked to death and lies in a pool of his own blood.
6. A jumbled collection of scattered household goods— clothes, a cooking pot and so on—lies scattered on the ground outside a home.
7. A raider—covered in blood and gore—sits slumped against a wall. An arrow protrudes from his throat, and his face is frozen in a grimace of hate and pain.
8. Smoke blows across the street, obscuring the characters' view. Humanoid shapes move within the smoke—and they seem to be running directly toward the party!
9. A broken barrel lies on its side amid a puddle of wine. A crude, bloody handaxe is embedded in the barrel.
10. A villager—an axe embedded in his back—crawls down the street. In great pain, he spots the party and loudly begs for aid.
11. Two raiders drag a woman from a smouldering house. Their backs are to the characters, and they do not appear to have noticed the adventurers.
12. A javelin flashes past the lead character's face and embeds itself in a nearby wall.
13. A blazing outbuilding collapses in on itself with a crash, throwing up a cloud of sparks and smoke.
14. Two children—one clutching a baby to its chest—dash from a side street and run straight at the party. Their soot-stained faces are streaked with tears. Behind them lumber two drunk warriors—intent on easy pickings. At the sight of the characters, they turn away.
15. The frenzied squealing of a horse in tremendous pain breaks through the clamour of battle.
16. An arrow falls from the sky and lands—quivering—at a character's feet. There's no indication who shot the arrow in question.
17. A hand cart lies on its side in the street—vegetables, along with a few hand tools, lie scattered on the ground.
18. A villager—clearly very dead—stands transfixed against a wall by a large spear driven through his chest.
19. A raider lies dead in the street, his skull caved in. Near his outstretched hand lies a yet burning torch.
20. The thatch of a nearby building is beginning to smoulder—a raider threw a torch onto its roof moments ago. A villager dashes out of the building, clutching a load of possessions to his chest. He dumps them onto the street and then runs back into the building. 





# WILDERNESS CAMPING 


## TRAVELLERS TO SHARE THE FIRE 



1. Burlop the Brave (CG male human fighter 8) and Jinnid (LG male human paladin 4): Burlop can be heard from at least a mile off. His bravado, rowdy guffaws and joyous proclamations carry through the air like the trumpet of an elephant. Six-foot tall and built like a bear, Burlop is clad in muddy hide armour and a feathered helmet. His giant smile and vivacious charm are visible beneath a thick layer of dirt and scruff. Beside him trails Jinnid, his mute and faithful squire. Burlop immediately identifies the characters as fellow adventurers (accurately or not). As Jinnid cooks a rabbit, Burlop helps himself to the party's drink and food. He brags loudly of his own (admittedly impressive) accomplishments, asks of the characters' quests before quickly segueing back into his own deeds. If confronted, Burlop is cowed and embarrassed and flounders into a glum silence. However, if praised, he shares valuable contacts in the nearest city or informs the characters of a treasure he is too busy to collect.
2. Gryzob (LN female orc fighter 5): Gryzob swaggers into the firelight, all snarl, scowl, and tusk. She stands menacingly for a few moments, then warms herself by the flame without so much as a “hello.” Gryzob was hired muscle for a travelling elven merchant until racial tensions proved too much for the pairing. The orc lost the fight and fled, fuming into the darkness to happen across the characters. She is injured, holding pressure to a small but deep rapier wound to the stomach. If untreated, the wound festers and kills her in days. Gryzob is surly and does not desire conversation. If angered (an easy feat), she challenges her perceived aggressor to a duel. After all, she must regain some pride after losing to an elf.
3. Zopher Zyznana (NG male half-elf): Zopher can be heard by the clacking of pots and the ringing of bells that hang from his overlarge pack. A tinker and trader, the half-elf is an excellent conversationalist and lively camp-mate. He peddles a range of mundane but unusual goods, from witching bells to shrunken heads to glass dolls, all the while blowing marvellous smoke shapes from his pipe.
4. Potlam Geldstone (CN male human): Potlam quietly approaches the fire and politely asks permission to join the party. A child of nine, he speaks with a nobleman's lilt and wears dusty but expensive clothes. He has no pack, no weapons and no travelling equipment. A slightly spoiled but otherwise rambunctious and likeable boy, Potlam ran away from home three days ago to see the world. Annoyed at his parent's overprotection, he is eager to have an adventure. He begs to join the party, but fetches a hefty reward if returned to his family.
5. Yezcha Silverhair (CE female halfling thief 3): Yezcha is an unassuming older hobbit, her long black hair streaked with grey. She carries a small pack and claims to be making a short journey to visit her son, a wealthy merchant in a nearby town. She reads a book and keeps to herself but asks to sleep in camp for the night. However, there is no son. Yezcha is a thief and takes the first opportunity to steal a valuable item and flee.
6. Tuppus Smmendyyn (LG female gnome illusionist 6): A crack of thunder and lightning in the near distance precede Tuppus' arrival by minutes. She is comically misdressed for the weather, and her robes and beard are singed. Dazed, she asks odd questions about her location and nearby ley-lines, and mumbles arcane nonsense with every response. After some confused deliberation, she determines her experimental teleportation spell went somewhat amiss. Tuppus requests escort to the nearest town or city and promises the characters some arcane favour in return.
7. Milnan (NE male human): Milnan steps into the firelight, dagger drawn. He is gaunt and sweating, with black veins webbing his pale flesh. Stuttering, he demands gold between involuntary face spasms. Milnan is a skez head, completely addicted to the drug. Desperate and willing to do anything for his next hit, he is nonetheless unlikely to pose a real threat to the characters.
8. Unlucky Petar (NG male half-orc thief 4): Unlucky Petar politely hails the group from a distance. He is dressed as an adventurer, complete with leather armour, a short sword and an unpainted hide buckler. He makes pleasant conversation as he eats his trail rations and inquires about recent news. His own story is a comedy of disasters. Employed by no fewer than six adventuring companies, he watched as each one fell prey to some unlucky mishap. From each, Petar emerged the sole survivor. Petar is making his way back to civilisation from such a misadventure and offers his services for pay if the characters seem friendly (and competent). 





## NOTABLE CAMP CHARACTERISTICS 



1. The campsite is prone to flooding; if it rains heavily while the party camp here, they are in for an unpleasant surprise after a few hours. Alternatively, the ground could already be waterlogged.
2. The campsite straddles a game trail. During the night, numerous foxes, badgers and other nocturnal creatures scuttle through, or around, the camp.
3. The characters have found a sheltered dell complete with a small spring bubbling out of the ground that fills a shallow pool of fresh water.
4. One of the trees standing at the campsite's fringe is “dead standing”. If a high wind hits the campsite, the tree could topple to the ground.
5. The campsite follows the contours of the land and is long, thin and undulating. Although mainly flat, it stands between two precipitous slopes. It is invisible from the nearest trail.
6. Several trees have fallen across the area. They form natural windbreaks and even provide concealment from casual observers.
7. A fire recently raged through the area. Nothing remains but scorched earth, blackened stumps and so on. A single forlorn oak—bark blackened and leaf-stripped— survived the conflagration.
8. Boulders and rubble lie strewn across the area. There is barely anywhere large enough to lie down. It takes hours of effort to clear a space to pitch the party's tents.
9. A crumbling wall of ancient origin bounds one side of the site. Overgrown with weeds and brambles, the mosscovered stones look as old as the world.
10. The campsite is a small hollow atop a high, steep-sided hill. The summit commands sweeping views of the surrounds. It is a highly defensible position, virtually impossible to approach unobserved. 

## SIGNS OF PREVIOUS CAMPERS 



1. An old, mouldy boot stands on a flat bit of ground between two saplings sprouting from a low, mossy bank.
2. A slender rope has been strung at roughly shoulder height between two trees. It is slightly mouldy. A Perceptive character noticed a balled-up weather-beaten tarpaulin caught in the roots of a nearby gnarly oak tree.
3. A fire pit, ringed by scorched stones, stands in the middle of a patch of cleared ground. Here, the shrubs have been cut back and some attempt has been made to clear away fallen leaves and brush. The burnt remains of several branches lie amid the campfire's cold ashes.
4. A small, bugling hemp sack stands propped up against a tree. Investigations reveal it is full of empty wineskins.
5. This campsite appears pristine and unused. However, an unlucky character leaving the camp—perhaps to relieve himself—discovers an unburied shallow latrine by standing it in. Unfortunately, recent rain has reduced the contents to a kind of viscous slop.
6. The ground slopes upwards in the characters' direction of travel. Someone has taken the time to scrape out a flat section just large enough for a couple of bedrolls.
7. A ripped and weather-worn, wind-blown cloak hangs from the branches of a thorn bush. It flutters in a faint breeze, making a rustling sound.
8. A shallow fire pit stands in the lee of a small rise. Nearby, several small piles of firewood stand ready to use.
9. Some attempt has been made to screen this spot from a nearby path. Fallen branches have been arranged in a haphazard screen of sorts and the camp's fire pit is positioned behind a mossy pile of stones.
10. Trash—the leavings of an extended camp—cover the ground. The rubbish includes frayed rope, a mouldy tent and several wine flasks. Perceptive characters can make out the “footprints” of four tents. 





## THINGS LIVING AT THE CAMPSITE 



1. Wasps have a nest high up in a nearby tree. Depending on the time of year, they could be dopy or aggressive.
2. A badger set pierces the sheltered slope of a slight rise. The badgers emerge at night to feed. They are only aggressive if attacked or cornered.
3. An owl lurks in a nearby tree. It emerges at dusk to hunt. When it returns, clutching a dead mouse, it sits in the tree devouring its prey and watching the characters. It is so silent the characters might not even notice it.
4. A fox den lies nearby. The mated pair and their young emerge to hunt and play if the characters are relatively quiet. The young are fearless and scavenge through the camp for food scraps.
5. A vast ant nest honeycombs the ground under the campsite. Characters sleeping on the ground (and their kit) are infested with ants the next morning.
6. Two rival male squirrels claim the area. When the character arrives, the two are chattering at each other.
7. Nests festoon the branches of the surrounding trees, but all are empty. What could have forced so many birds to leave? Did they migrate or fall prey to a predator?
8. A dense patch of wild berry bushes grows throughout the area. The berries are ripe and delicious.
9. A shaded, reed-fringed tranquil pool is home to several dozen carp and one old and grumpy pike. Here, the fishing is good!
10. A stream winds its way through the campsite. Among the reeds clustering thickly on its steep banks live a female duck and her four young. Initially unseen, the youngs' high-pitched quacking quickly betrays their presence. 

## THINGS LURKING IN THE SHADOWS 



1. Rustling in the bushes near the camp grows steadily louder and louder. After a few minutes, a family of badgers—two adults and three young—emerge from the bushes and sniff about the camp in search of food.
2. A large owl glides silently over the camp. When it is directly overhead it lets out a loud, deep hoot.
3. With a loud crash and rustling of undergrowth, something falls to the ground not too far from camp. (A rotten branch has fallen from a tree, but the characters are unlikely to know that—paranoid adventurers may believe a dragon or has dropped something or that some winged beast has just landed).
4. Something large passes in front of the stars, blotting it out for several seconds.
5. A small swarm of bats is hunting. If the party has set a fire the light and the smell of burning wood keeps them away from the camp's immediate environs but the sound of them moving through the trees—unseen—may unnerve the character on watch.
6. A wolf's howl obviously some distance off is answered by a much louder howl…coming from close by.
7. Jennan Royce (LN female human): Jennan approaches the fire silently and shell shocked. Her clothes are torn, and her face is dirty except where tears have cleaned it away. To her breast, she clutches a baby wrapped in brown cloth. Jennan is on the run from some threat appropriate to the characters' level (bandits, a rampaging troll, a vindictive dragon or the like). She escaped with her child, but the rest of her village was massacred. Jennan accepts food and care distractedly and without thanks. However, if any character moves to touch her child, she swats them away. Sadly, their help comes too late. The child died in the attacks, and Jennan is deep in denial.
8. A pair of small red eyes regard the camp from a nearby stand of bushes. The eyes are unblinking and watch the camp for several minutes before abruptly disappearing. The cat could be feral or could be a wizard's familiar sent to spy on the party.
9. A swarm of fireflies passes over the camp. Their luminescent bodies provide a spectacular display as thousands of insects twist and weave through the night.
10. Basson Clayhanger (CN male halfling ghost): A shivering halfling approaches the fire, and moves to warm his blue hands by the flame. He is oblivious to the characters, consumed by a fruitless effort to absorb some of the campfire's heat. Basson is icy cold, and his breath mists the air. If confronted, he dissolves into an icy vapour that floats from the campground. Should the characters follow the freezing ectoplasm, they come across an old campsite and a frozen halfling corpse (regardless of the current temperature). Unless the characters burn the body to give the poor soul rest, the ghost returns to their campfire every night they remain in the area. 





## NIGHT-TIME CAMPSITE EVENTS 



1. A light sprinkling of rain falls on the camp. Little more than a drizzle, it falls for an hour or so.
2. One of the larger sticks in the party's campfire burns through the middle, and its bits fall into the fire throwing up a sudden cloud of sparks.
3. A faint rustling in the bushes reaches the guard's ear. It stops and starts several times over a period of about ten minutes. Investigations reveal a badger and her young.
4. A sudden wind blows through the camp plucking at the guard's cloak and fanning the campfire. If the guard is unlucky, the wind might blow a few embers from the fire onto a tent or sleeping adventurer. If the unfortunate guard is also inattentive, a small fire could result.
5. Clouds pass over the moon, plunging the campsite into even deeper darkness. As deep shadows gather about the camp, the temperature drops several degrees.
6. An owl perches on a tree nearby and starts to hoot. Unless driven off, the owl continues to hoot on and off for hours potential disrupting the characters' sleep.
7. A small, non-venomous snake slithers through the camp in search of prey. It is timid and flees if attacked. Inattentive guards may not see it until it gets quite close to them. Alternatively, those not wise in the ways of nature may assume the snake is poisonous and rouse their comrades for nothing.
8. A faint drumming sound drifts through the night air. It comes from some unknown distant point and continues for several hours before eventually stopping.
9. The guard develops the distinct impression someone or something is watching the camp. Investigations reveal no apparent signs of such a watcher, but the feeling refuses to fade.
10. One of the slumbering adventurers—or attendant NPC— has a nightmare. He tosses, turns and murmurs in his sleep. Eventually, he wakes up screaming.
11. The warmth of the campfire and the sonorous snoring of their companions begin to lull the guard to sleep. They jolt awake a few moments later; no one notices their infraction, and no ill-harm seems to have occurred.
12. Somewhere off in the distance, an animal shrieks in pain.
13. The wind whistles through the campsite. The branches of nearby trees creak, groan and loudly clack together.
14. A fox scurries through the campsite, clutching a small, limp mouse in its mouth.
15. A crashing sound in the distance heralds a rotten branch falling from a nearby tree. It's a thick branch and makes a hell of a crash.
16. One of the party begins to talk in his sleep. The speech seems to be complete gibberish. Disturbingly, they occasionally pause—as if listening to a response from some unknown source.
17. Suddenly—and for seemingly no reason—a rope on one of the party's tents snaps. It immediately begins to sag, which wakes up at least one of its occupants.
18. Clouds scud across the sky, the moon's light eerily shining through them. Deep shadows dance amongst the party's tents. A paranoid or over-anxious guard might believe the shadows cluster about one particular spot in the camp.
19. It gets unusually cold for the season, in the depths of the night. Ill-equipped adventurers sleep poorly.
20. The guard falls asleep and slumbers through the entire night. Consequently, they do not wake any of the characters to take their shift. Nothing fell befalls the party as a consequence of the guard's error, but the guard does remember feeling suddenly and inexplicably sleepy just before the end of their vigil. 





## ABANDONED THINGS AT A CAMPSITE 



1. The charred remains of several bloody rags lie among the ashes of an old campfire. There is, however, no sign of violence.
2. An abandoned two-man tent lies crumbled on the ground. One end is still attached to its guide ropes while the other flaps despondently in the breeze.
3. A jumbled pile of firewood stands under the boughs of a tree off to one side of the campfire. A small stash of full waterskins has been hidden under the pile.
4. Food wrappers lie scattered about the camp, rustling in the breeze. The party's noses lead them to a shallow latrine hole that the campers did not bother to cover over before leaving.
5. A single much-patched tent stands in the shadow of a tall tree. Within, the party find a bedroll, backpack and several days' worth of food along with other miscellaneous camping gear.
6. A rudimentary attempt has been made to hide this old campsite. The low hanging branches of a tree have been pulled down and secured with rope to several iron spikes driven deep into the earth. The spikes are rusting and the rope is festooned with mould.
7. The ground around this central fire pit is churned up and splattered with dried blood. Trackers among the party can make out the signs of a terrible struggle as well as the “footprints” of three tents.
8. A rusting hatchet stands where it was left, embedded in the side of a tree clearly too large to be brought down by such a small weapon.
9. This was clearly a semi-permanent camp at some point. Someone spent considerable time cutting down tree branches and dragging them back to camp to create interlaced walls of tumbled wood. The space inside the “walls” is large enough for a half-dozen tents.
10. This campsite has four small fire pits spread evenly around its perimeter; the grass and vegetation in the space between the fires has been squashed flat— suggesting several people slept therein.
11. A ragged mottled green and brown cloak hangs from a tree's low branches.
12. The skinned, gutted and now decomposing remains of a deer have been dumped about 30 ft. away from camp.
13. A crude map of the surrounding terrain has been drawn into a patch of mud with a sharp stick. Several portions of the map have been effaced by animals or rain.
14. By the looks of things, the campfire at this camp got a little out of hand. A nearby tree's branches have been scorched and the burn patterns on the ground extend well beyond the fire's stone ring.
15. Wind-blown leaves cover much of this site. A small leaf drift covers a shredded sack containing seemingly nothing more than rotting clothes. A perceptive character, however, searching the clothes finds a small leather pouch containing 3 gp and 7 sp.
16. A waterlogged book lies discarded on a low, flat stone. Once a religious tract of a local religion the book is now nothing more than a sodden mass of parchment; only the cover remains legible.
17. The remains of several crude animal snares surround this campsite; all are empty.
18. A shallow grave—topped with a smattering of stones surrounded by wildflowers—stands near a gurgling stream. A ring of smooth stones—no doubt pulled from the nearby stream—surround the grave like a fence.
19. A broken lantern lies on its side partially covered by leaves and other wind-blown detritus. Any oil within has long since drained away.
20. A large tarpaulin hangs between two trees suspended by stout hemp rope and anchored by several iron spikes.

1. Two tors rear up from the rolling grassland, providing a modicum of protection from the prevailing winds. Characters exploring the tors discover the remains of a crumbled drystone wall between the two.
2. At the head of a narrow valley, a small stream tumbles down a waterfall into a sheltered pool. Small, stunted trees grow along the pool's fringes. Unless the stream is in flood, the pool's banks are dry and could serve as an excellent campsite.
3. A series of linked deep depressions in the moor provides a handy, sheltered campsite out of the wind— unless it has recently been raining (in which case boggy mud fills the depressions).
4. A shallow cave pierces one flank of a craggy tor, providing semi-comfortable shelter for four human-sized creatures. The cold remains of a campsite, and soot stains on the cave's rear wall and ceiling, show other travellers have rested here.
5. Ancient woodland surrounds and hides two small lakes set in a depression in the moor overlooked by a nameless tor of tumbled stone. Fishing is good in the lake, and the trees keep the worst of the moor's wind at bay. Butterflies and birds dwell here in profusion, in the summer months.
6. A dry cave cuts into the side of a rocky tor. A dwarf or other miner can tell the cave is not a natural thing. A breastwork of stone—covered in lichen and moss— protects the cave's approaches.
7. A shallow depression amid a stand of gorse bushes and field of tumbled stone provides a sheltered spot to camp. A narrow winding path leads through the gorse to the depression, suggesting someone—or something—has made regular use of the site.
8. The crumbling remains of a large building—perhaps a hunting lodge or travellers' inn—offers shelter. While the building has no roof, most of its walls still stand, providing protection from the wind and observation from casual observers.
9. A long ridge-like tor of dark stone juts upwards from the moor. Characters scaling its flanks discover a number of spread-out natural sheltered hollows along its length big enough for a single occupant.
10. An old mine entrance pierces a bank. The mine's leavings lie scattered all around amid the undergrowth. Although the narrow mine tunnel has collapsed about 30 ft. into the hill there is enough room for travellers to huddle inside.
11. Thickets of sharp-leaved holly trees grow interspersed with oak and beech trees in the lea of a line of tortopped, steep exposed hills.
12. Moss-covered trees grow thickly along the course of a narrow, swiftly flowing river. A crude clapper bridge crosses the river and leads to a swath of low-lying, sheltered ground next to the river. Mossy boulders abound, here. 





## LOCAL LANDMARKS 



1. A gnarled oak tree, its crown grown sideways and lopsided, stands alone amid the wind-blasted landscape. Named “the Old Man” it is a well-known landmark; locals press copper coins into its ribbed bark as offerings to the god of travel for a safe journey.
2. A deep river valley cuts through this section of moorland. Within the valley stunted and gnarled oak trees grow amid a field of moss-wreathed boulders and tumbled rotting tree trunks. Vipers lurk amid the boulders, but only strike at intruders if disturbed.
3. The flint-hued waters of a wide, but shallow, lake lie prostrate under the moorland's ever-changing sky. A winding, muddy track leads to the lake and many animals—sheep, wild horses and the like—can be encountered in the vicinity. A shepherd's hut of dry stone built into a slight rise overlooks the lake.
4. The shattered, jagged ruin of an ancient tower rises from atop a high, steep-sided tor. The ruin is visible for miles around and it is known locally as the “Jagged Tooth”.
5. The ruin of an ancient part-sunken village lies scattered across a wide valley. Low stone walls protrude from the ground and provide some protection from the wind. (Buried treasure might lie under hearthstones or amid the burial cairns ringing the settlement).
6. A stone circle of obviously ancient construct stands amid a wild swath of heather. A river—spanned by a simple stone clapper-style bridge—cuts through the circle.
7. Giant mossy boulders and large fern-covered trees dominate this small, steep-sided river valley. The valley descends steeply, and the stream drops over several waterfalls—Dingle's Steps—before flowing through four deep plunge pools and out onto the open moor.
8. The lonely, wind-battered and slate-rooted Halfway Inn stands astride a deeply gouged track leading across the moor. Sunken in places, the track is an ancient route. Legends speak of ghostly travellers and of the lich who sometimes stalks its length in search of fresh souls, but the welcome is always warm at the Halfway Inn.
9. A rusting iron ladder enables (increasingly perilous) access to Soul Tor's summit. A chasm pierces the tor, plunging deep into the moor's bedrock. Rumours speak of incomprehensible runes cut into the rock at the base of the chasm and of strange sounds echoing across the moor when a gibbous moon hangs low in the sky.
10. A vast and ancient yew tree stands in splendid isolation amid the tumbled ruin of a crumbling church. Built by a cleric centuries ago allegedly to ward off an ancient evil spoken of in certain fragmentary elder prophecies the church fell into disrepair with the cleric's demise.
11. A natural amphitheatre—Giants' Meet—surrounds a glimmering moorland lake. But one twisted path cuts through the surrounding hills to reach the site. Close investigation of the stepped amphitheatre reveals what could be tool marks—worn almost completely away by long years of exposure to the moor's harsh climate.
12. This series of five plunge pools break up a brook's wandering path down from a swath of well-watered uplands. Known as Shilla's Pools this set of pools is renowned for its clean and fresh water. Hidden in a deep fold in the land, if it was not for the tinkling melody of running water, most travellers would not find the brook.
13. Six hut circles lie stark on this wild, sweeping swath of moorland. Mossy, tumbled drystone walls surround the long-abandoned settlement's fields. Locals call the site Bone Tor to mark the bone-filled pit allegedly found at the centre of the settlement decades ago.
14. A deep pool—Long Pool—lies at the bottom of a waterfall in a steep-sided ravine running through a range of hills. The place is secluded, and—for the brave—a good place for swimming and diving. Local rumour, however, places a mischievous water spirit in the pool, and several people are said to have drowned therein.
15. Worn earthworks and ditches surround a high hill ringed with tumbled drystone walls. One of the ditches is known as Dead Woman's Ditch. The woman's ghost is said to haunt the ancient hill fort.
16. A weather-worn carving of a single lidless eye decorates this fallen obelisk. Lichen and ferns grow about and over the tumbled stone; only observant characters spot the carving. The obelisk is known locally as the Watcher.
17. A swath of swampy ground cuts across the moor. Pockmarked by stunted, sickly-looking trees the area is known as Dead Man's Rest. Various rumours place a small pack of will-o-wisps in the area, and those in the know avoid coming here.
18. Several streams flow downwards to a wide lake nestled between three jagged tors. The forlorn ruin of a fortified keep—partially sunk in the mud and muck of a low-lying island—emerges from the lake. The Keep of Drowned Souls, as it is known, was once ruled by the infamous robber-baron Kildrak Witchbane. The keep is rumoured to have extensive (flooded) cellars and dungeons.
19. Of dwarven construct, this old stone bridge spans a river gushing down from the high moor. Rapids and waterfalls pockmark this stretch of river. The bridge is the only safe place to cross for miles in each direction.
20. This gigantic, thirty-foot high stone obelisk stands in stark splendour in this otherwise remote, featureless stretch of moorland. Graven with many weatherworn symbols, the obelisk has begun to lean drunkenly in recent years—no doubt due to the efforts of treasurehunting travellers. Such folk believe the obelisk is the gravemarker of a giant who died of over-exertion while dragging a great store of loot back to his lair—the nearby Giant's Seat tor. 





## MINOR DAYTIME EVENTS 



1. Persistent drizzle sweeps across the moors, blown by a strong wind. Quickly, the exposed rocks emerging from the earth and short coarse grass become slick.
2. A smudge of smoke on the horizon shows where a campfire still burns. Alternatively, a remote steading could be under attack by raiders or a small piece of moor could be aflame.
3. Clouds scud quickly across the sky, creating deep patches of shadow that seem to rush across the moorland like hunters searching for prey.
4. A falcon wheels high overhead. With a cry, it dives to the ground before returning to the air with a struggling (doomed) rabbit in its claws. It flies off to a nearby tor where it nests with its mate and young.
5. A lone piebald riding horse, wearing bit, bridle, saddle and saddlebags, ambles across the moor. Of its rider, there is no sign. The horse has a distinctive black and white pattern; if the characters encounter the owner's friends, they'll have some explaining to do.
6. Blinding sun breaks through the clouds; perceptive characters note it reflecting off something metallic some way distant. The reflection could be the light reflecting off a still pool of water, the armour of some lurking foe or a piece of discarded equipment.
7. A viper slithers through the undergrowth. Perceptive characters catch sight of its jagged pattern of red and black scales as it moves parallel to the characters. It does not attack, unless provoked.
8. A faint mist blankets the moor, giving everything an ethereal feel; the mist reduces visibility by half but luckily does not thicken further.
9. A fox darts across the party's path, carrying a dead rabbit in its jaws. It seems to grin at the characters as it disappears into the undergrowth with its prize.
10. One of the party veers from the path—perhaps to relieve themselves—and has the misfortune to blunder into a stretch of boggy ground. Quickly, the character's boots are covered in thick, squelchy mud. If the character is tremendously unlucky, the mud acts like quicksand and begins to drag them down to a watery doom.
11. A cold and clammy heavy fog cloaks the moor, reducing visibility to mere feet. Sounds are strangely deadened in the fog, and travellers have twice the normal chance of getting lost. The fog could lift quickly or linger all day.
12. The distant drumming of hooves gets louder as they get closer. Shortly a herd of wild horses canters into view from behind a hill. The horses have been spooked and are fleeing some predator real or imagined. The herd splits and passes either side of the party. 

## MINOR NIGHTTIME EVENTS 



1. The stars blaze down on the campsite. The occasional cloud scuds across the sky obscuring this star and then that. A paranoid guard might think the clouds are some form of gigantic invisible flying predator.
2. The temperature drops precipitously overnight. Only well equipped or magically protected characters sleep well. If the party travel in autumn or winter, frost cloaks the ground when dawn breaks.
3. Several slow-moving indistinct forms approach the camp. Although the creatures are quiet they don't seem to be sneaking. When a character can get a good look at the creatures, they discover the intruders are sheep.
4. A light drizzle falls in the early hours of the morning, and the air smells of rain. However, by dawn, the clouds have dispersed and the day is brilliantly sunny and warm.
5. A viper slithers through the camp, in search of prey. It hunts rabbits, dormice and other small creatures. It may give a character a scare, but much prefers to slither away than fight large creatures.
6. Flying from some distant roost a swarm of bats flutters across the night sky. If the party has a campfire or uses other bright lights at night, the swarm investigates. If the characters follow the bats back to their roost they discover a small cave complex or disused mine. Adventure may lurk within.
7. The wind whines across the open moorland, sounding vaguely like a lament (perhaps of all the lost souls who have died in the bleak surrounds).
8. A shooting star blazes across the sky. A few minutes later, another two follow the first. The stars are falling in the direction the characters will travel on the morrow.
9. In the dead of the night, the air grows suddenly still as the wind drops away to nothing—for a few moments all is peaceful and it seems like even the moor itself is holding its breath.
10. Flickering lights—perhaps torches or guttering lanterns— glimmer far away. Distances are hard to fathom in the dark, but the lights are probably miles away.
11. A large winged creature passes in front of the moon. The creature has a long sinuous tail and seems to be grasping something in its mouth. (This is a wyvern returning to its lair after having caught a wild pony).
12. In the dead of night, a character on guard notices a faint glowing blue-green light near the camp. At first, the glow is akin to a candle, but it slowly grows brighter until it provides as much light as a torch. If the character approaches the light, it retreats into the moor. (This is a will-o-wisp trying to lure a character to a lonely death). 





## WILDERNESS DRESSING 



1. The moor's undulating terrain expands toward the horizon, only interspersed by occasional rocky tors. On the horizon, perceptive characters can make out a small band of half-dozen travellers.
2. The decomposing body of a sheep lies amid the bracken—flies covering the corpse rise in a buzzing cloud, if disturbed.
3. Thick stands of rushes hint at where—at the bottom of a gentle slope—boggy ground lurks ready to waylay incautious travellers. If the characters are particularly unlucky, some parts of the bog could act like quicksand.
4. A gurgling, fast-flowing stream cuts through the moorland; pockmarked with a series of deep plunge pools and sections of rapids the stream is challenging to cross when in full spate.
5. Overgrown with bracken and wildflowers a tumbled drystone wall surrounds an ancient burial cairn.
6. An old rutted wagon track wends its way through the landscape, following the ground's contours. It leads to an old partially flooded open-pit mine surrounded by heaps of spoils that look—to the untrained eye—like natural features of the surrounds.
7. Wild horses graze, seemingly unconcerned by travellers. An elf, ranger or druid can approach the horses without spooking them; all others cause the horses to gallop away if they get within 20 feet.
8. A veritable field of rubble and rocks lies hidden within and under thick gorse and heather. Unwary travellers could turn an ankle on a hidden obstruction. In battle, the hidden obstacles could break up an enemy's charge, trip a horse or disrupt a shield wall.
9. The bleached bones of a horse lie amid bracken. Partially sunken into the mud, the bones have obviously been here for a season or more.
10. A swath of bare soil and the twisted blackened remains of bushes and the like show where a wildfire burnt. Amid the conflagration lies the splintered, twisted bones of three humanoids and their worthless gear.
11. Only tough, thick grass and low stunted gorse bushes grow in this wild, lonely place.
12. Tracks amid the mud and mire show where a group of humanoids travelled. A ranger, or other skilled in tracking, can determine the tracks are only a few hours old and that the travellers are going in the same direction as the party.
13. A great swath of colourful wildflowers carpets this stretch of east-facing sloped ground. Several large grey boulders break up the display.
14. An escapement—its base wreathed in deep shadows— cuts across the moor parallel to the party's direction of travel. The escarpment is steep, and an impossible barrier if the party has mounts and pack animals.
15. A burial cairn surmounted by a ragged battle standard hanging from a lopsided spear thrust deep into the stones stands beside the track. Freshly picked flowers are laid on the cairn. The battle standard depicts a rampant red lion on a black background.
16. A stone waymarker juts from the surrounding gorse and heather. The marker is worn and pockmarked by weather; its inscription has long since faded into illegibility, but it still points in the direction of the nearest settlement (whether that settlement is now abandoned or occupied).
17. A thick hawthorn and gorse hedge grows in the lea of an old drystone wall. The thick vegetation and wall make a formidable barrier.
18. A small pyramid of stones juts from amid a thick swath of reeds filling a low depression in the ground which the track skirts. The pyramid seems too small for a burial cairn but is obviously not natural.
19. Dark water laden with peat and fringed with rushes and stones lies in the shadow of a nearby hill. Glints of white bone are visible jutting from the shallow pool's fringes.
20. A field of boulders covers the slope of a steep, tortopped hill. Climbing the hill is a slow slog, but its summit commands excellent views of the surrounds. 





## UNEVENTFUL TRAVEL 



1. Leaden clouds darken the sky and strong winds gust across the moor. The temperature plummets and dusk comes early.
2. Rainclouds smudge the horizon, and drizzle periodically besets the characters. The rain clears in mid-afternoon.
3. Around midday the characters spot clouds of smoke on the horizon—a steading could be under attack or a section of moor could be aflame (perhaps after being struck by lightning or being ignited by an errant spell).
4. After an uneventful day's travel pockmarked by drizzle, the characters search for a campsite. On the horizon, the end of a rainbow seems to caress—or point to—a low, stumpy tor set into the side of a valley. The tor commands sweeping views of the terrain beyond. Perhaps buried treasure or a doorway into the fey's realm lies in the vicinity.
5. The party see no other travellers all day; their only company is a small flock of sheep and a few wandering wild horses.
6. Bright sunlight warms the moor for much of this day. Flies and midges infest several streams and rivers along the characters' path and all of them suffer various bites and irritations during the day's travel.
7. The track the party followed for much of the day terminates at the bound of a boggy section of low ground. A narrow wooden causeway—rotten in places— crosses the mire, but the characters reach the area as dusk falls.
8. The party moves through a sunken valley of gnarly old oak trees, mossy boulders and softly tinkling streams. The valley is isolated and steep-sided. The party see no one else until they return to the open moor.
9. Fog blankets the moor when the party awakens but by mid-morning the sun has burnt it away. Consequently, the party's rate of travel is only halved for the first few hours of the day. The wind is still, and when night falls a myriad of stars blaze forth from a cloudless sky.
10. The day is cool and the wind brisk. As the party trudge across the moor, they see nothing of interest except grazing sheep and—once—two distant shepherds mounted on stout ponies. The shepherds wave, but do not approach the adventurers.
11. Heavy rain lashes the moors all day. If the party leaves their shelter (if they have any) they are swiftly drenched. No one else is abroad in such weather, and the party encounter no other travellers.
12. Crossing through a low-lying area the party squelch onwards, reaching higher ground just after noon. From there, the going is drier, but cooler. When the cloudless night comes, the temperature drops precipitously. 





# WIZARD' S TOWER 







## TOWER DECORATIONS 



1. This large black tapestry covers one entire wall; small interwoven silver beads depict the best-known constellations. Perceptive characters note another constellation they don't recognise; this one is picked out with small red beads.
2. Wrought iron torch sconces protrude from the walls; the sconces look like the blackened claws of some kind of terrible, mythical beast.
3. A pentagram covers much of the floor. The ornate and intricate design is cut into the floor, and its tiny channels are full of glistening mercury.
4. Thick red curtains hang down from the ceiling around the walls and obscure any doors or other openings. Behind the curtains, several cunningly-cut holes channel the wind from outside; when the wind is strong enough, this causes the curtains to oscillate.
5. This chamber's walls are whitewashed. However, perceptive characters can just make out the shadow of an image below the whitewash.
6. This door frame is decorated with intricate carvings of a swarm of tiny hands grasping at the door; paranoid characters may suspect this is a trap.
7. The floor is of one-foot square alternating yellow and black flagstones. The yellow flagstones look older and more worn than the black.
8. Soot mars the ceiling, although there doesn't seem to be any obvious source of the fire.
9. A fan of daggers—all of different craftsmanship and make —decorates one wall. The daggers come from a variety of races and cultures; some are crafted by orcs or goblins while others are of human manufacture. One impossibly slender blade is clearly of elven origin.
10. A scorched and battered suit of chainmail sits on a stand in a small niche in one wall.
11. Small niches pierce the walls at roughly knee height. A sconce sized for a candle fills each niche, and dried candle wax of various colours covers the bottom of each niche (and, in some cases, has dripped onto the floor).
12. A portrait of the wizard adorns one wall; he is pictured clad in the finest robes, his fingers and throat heavy with jewellery. Behind him, lies an alien landscape and motes of light cluster about this head.
13. A cracked and blackened skull of probably human origin lurks in a deep niche in the wall; small black curtains flank the niche.
14. Esoteric runes—in the ancient magical language—snake around the room at waist height. Characters able to read the runes realise they are a form of ritualistic protection against scrying.
15. A picture set into an ornate and gaudy frame depicts a great granite throne standing alone in a deep cavern. The dust of ages is upon the throne and its surroundings. Small letters hidden in the bottom left corner of the picture identify the scene as "The God- Throne." The picture is unsigned.
16. A fabulously detailed blown-glass figurine standing on a side table depicts a rearing unicorn.
17. Surprisingly life-like carvings of a multitude of stone bats hang from the ceiling.
18. A crudely painted picture of the wizard dead in his coffin hangs on one wall. The picture is signed by the wizard himself (in a trembling hand).
19. Protective sigils are etched into the wall above every door and window. The sigils are filled with a mix of lead and silver and are designed to ward against scrying and teleportation magic.
20. A beautiful rug of exquisite craftsmanship covers a large portion of the floor. The map depicts the surrounding area and shows the location of several hidden tombs, derelict wizard's towers and other adventure sites. 

## INTERESTING TOWER FEATURES 



1. A sundial in the tower always casts a shadow to indicate the correct time, although it is not in sunlight.
2. A small depression in the floor serves as a well of sorts. Although it is only a foot deep and has no obvious water source, the “well” never runs dry.
3. The tower's windows are opaque from the outside, denying anyone a view of what goes on within.
4. This whitewashed tower gleams brightly in the sunlight. During daylight hours, strange shadows and shapes writhe across its white walls.
5. The mortar used to build the tower is laced with lead; thus, detect magic from outside reveals nothing of what lies within.
6. Dozens of carven gargoyles decorate the tower; sometimes, they seem to move or shift location.
7. Intricate mosaic windows depicting ancient, famous wizards admit a riot of colour into the tower's interior.
8. An impossibly slender and long flagpole atop the tower flies a flag emblazoned with the wizard's sigil; no matter the weather, the flag flutters majestically. 





## THINGS ON A WIZARD' S BOOKSHELF 



1. This hardback tome entitled Kriptograf details common cyphers and methods of decryption and is written in a somewhat archaic form of Dwarven.
2. This work bound in soft leather is titled Lorebook of Pigments and discusses the ingredients of magical inks, how best to obtain and prepare them and acceptable substitutes for certain work.
3. This thin and unmarked book is a spellbook no more than twenty pages long. The only spells scribed inside are common cantrips, but the spellbook is worth 75 gp to a neophyte wizard.
4. Written in a flourishing script, and titled The Complete Draconic Lexicon, this sizeable dictionary is for the Draconic language and includes detailed etymology.
5. A tablet of grey stone sits at the end of a bookshelf. One side of it is carved with ancient practices and instructions for binding outsiders.
6. The words Genealogy Infernal: The Intermingling of the Great Lords and Mortals, are stamped across the cover of this book. Inside family trees of the half-mortal children of devils and their descendants fill the pages.
7. Titled Mage Illeswyte's History Arcanum, this sizeable tome is cased in heavy leather and records the known facts of wizardry's origins and development.
8. More a tightly bound stack of papers than a book, this work bears the heading The Ancient Mysteries of the Alabaster Tower. A quick perusal reveals it is a cheap work of fiction.
9. A burlap cover protects a collection of iron sheets strung together with chains. Each sheet is embossed with a unique diagram used for planar travel.
10. This neatly handwritten journal details a wizard's attempts to create new spells. Her methods are methodical and well documented; it's a helpful guide for any spellcaster looking to devise new magic.
11. The Lost Divinities is a book on the topic of deceased or vanished deities. It records the historical facts of their fall and further speculation and theory.
12. This battered, untitled treatise discusses spell-enhancing diagrams that work on the principle of “arcane resonance.” A skilled wizard quickly realises this book's claims are entirely fraudulent.
13. Once an atlas of a remote location, this book has a hole hollowed out inside. An ornate but functional iron dagger is concealed within.
14. The Roll of Spells has countless pages covered in tiny, precise text. The book lists the names and effects of thousands of spells.
15. A series of papers on theoretical aspects of arcane magic, speculating on its underlying principles, fill an old scroll case.
16. An old but well-maintained history book is kept inside a wooden box. It appears unremarkable, but to a collector, it's worth 250 gp.
17. Titled The Arcane Consequence, this moderately sized book discusses the direct and indirect effects of spells and the morality of magic, emphasising caution and forethought.
18. An untitled bestiary with thick parchment pages focuses on a wizard's interests, listing harvestable components and magical uses of numerous creatures.
19. This slim, white leather book bears the title A Plea for Necromancy. It addresses prejudice against necromancy and necromancy's useful applications.
20. The Origin of Magic contains many myths that explain how magic came into the world. 

## THINGS INSIDE A BOOK 



1. A scrap of weathered, aged parchment decorated with beautiful doodles of writhing arcane fire.
2. A single brilliant white feather that clearly hailed from a very large bird (or perhaps a more exotic creature).
3. A thrice-folded slip of parchment upon which has been written a shopping list of sorts. It appears whoever wrote the list was looking to restock a laboratory.
4. A large but fragile oak tree leaf. It is brittle to the touch and disintegrates if handled roughly.
5. A quill with a red ink-stained tip. The pages between which it lay are smeared with the same red ink.
6. A small pouch fashioned from a heavy piece of parchment is glued to the book's inside back cover; a few shiny grains of diamond dust yet linger within.
7. One of the book's pages is heavily smeared with dried blood; much of the page's contents are obscured, and the page is partially stuck to its neighbour.
8. A lock of long, jet black hair serves as a bookmark of sorts; tied at both ends with delicate strands of black silk, the whole gives off a faint odour of unidentifiable origin. 





## THINGS IN A WIZARD' S LABORATORY 



1. A disembodied, grey hand ending in sharp claws hangs suspended in a jar of dirty water. It might be a trick of the light, but the hand seems to flex every now and then.
2. One long wooden box of polished wood holds carefully arranged and straightened lengths of hair. Each set is tied together with bright blue string.
3. A small box holds an ancient coin minted thousands of years ago by a nation or race famed for its evil and brutality. The coin's features are nearly worn smooth such is its age. Perceptive characters might make out a few faint details—the suggestion of a face on one side and what looks like a fantastical creature on the other. The coin rests on a black velvet cushion.
4. A small earthen vial contains a thick dark red viscous fluid. This is the semi-coagulated blood of a basilisk.
5. A small stone beaker holds a small amount of carefully harvested green slime. There is not enough slime to consume a creature; the wizard studied the slime and occasionally used it to get rid of dangerous leavings from his experimentations.
6. This silver dagger's tip is broken off, and the remaining blade is dull with age. A gem once decorated the pommel, but it fell off long ago.
7. The surface of the wizard's workbench is scorched and burnt. Perceptive characters can just make out the remains of carvings in the wood, but their meaning is impossible to fathom.
8. A full, plain small earthen jar holds many dead and dried insect corpses.
9. A velvet pouch lies discarded on a shelf. It is empty, but flecks of glimmering dust inside the pouch hint at what it once held.
10. A skull stands atop a high shelf. Flickering, magical light emerges from its eye sockets, equivalent to a pair of candles. A small velvet cloth lies nearby. Perceptive characters notice that the top of the skull is detachable. If it is removed, heatless flames burst forth from the interior and provide light equivalent to a torch.
11. A wooden bin contains a small quantity of burnt or otherwise damaged laboratory equipment. All are worthless until repaired.
12. A rack holds a half-dozen potion vials. Each has been scrupulously cleaned and bares a label: healing, flight or invisibility. Sadly, all are empty (or invisible).
13. A workbook lies on the desk. It details—in broad strokes— the beginnings of research into lichdom. The wizard has not got very far; to date, they have only listed a lich's various abilities and characteristics.
14. A big sack stuffed in a corner holds a large quantity of damaged, scorched or dirty clothes. The stench of chemicals and strange reagents hangs over everything.
15. A small bucket of wet earth sits under the bench. The soil contains nothing of interest; rather, it is kept here to extinguish any unwanted (or sudden) fires.
16. This long, low wooden box has many compartments; each compartment contains a commonly available spell component—bat guano, coloured sand and so on. There are enough components in the box to fill five spell component pouches.
17. A cracked crystal ball stands on a bronze tripod. The tripod is very old, and the crystal ball falls apart if removed from the stand. If the ball breaks, it emits a small puff of smoke redolent with the smell of incense.
18. A high-backed wooden chair stands in a corner. Its intricately carved back is highly polished and depicts the entwined heads of two noble dragons.
19. A sheaf of parchments spilling from a leather folder depicts the various types of summoning circles and lists the kinds of creatures they are designed to contain.
20. Hidden in a concealed niche carved into the underside of the wizard's workbench lurks a small transparent gem. Golden sparkles glimmer within, and the thing radiates faint magic. 

## STRANGE SMELLS 



1. The faint odour of smoke mixed with strange, otherworldly incense hangs in the air.
2. Although its faint smell fills the area, the stench of ozone seems concentrated in one locale.
3. An overpowering, cloying smell of roses mixed with cinnamon hangs heavy in the area. Nearby, great vases of flowers hold dead or dying flowers.
4. Sulphur mixed with other unidentifiable chemicals fills the air with an acrid smell.
5. Sweat mixed with the pungent odour of manure hangs in this area.
6. The cloying, musty stench of death and decomposition hangs close to the floor. Smaller characters—halflings, gnomes and so on—detect the smell while taller characters do not (unless they stoop to their shorter companions' height). 





## SPELL COMPONENTS 



1. This small pouch contains four packets of coloured sand; red, yellow and blue sand is mixed up in each packet.
2. A cloying smell hangs about this small, circular tin of beaten bronze. Guano fills the container.
3. This small cracked prism gives the user a headache if it is looked through for too long.
4. Four white and black feathers are tied together with greyish twine.
5. This small packet created from a sheet of heavy parchment and closed with a plain waxen seal holds a small amount of gold dust.
6. A small drawstring pouch holds a half dozen acorns and a sprig of holly and five pieces of mistletoe. An included note reads, "Harvested on the summer solstice."
7. This heavily padded pouch holds a small crystal sphere about the size of a halfling's fist. The crystal is completely free of blemishes, scratches or other imperfections.
8. A piece of cloth covered in dried mud.
9. A small clump of wool impregnated with dried wax.
10. This tightly-stoppered tiny potion vial holds an ounce or so of blood.
11. A dozen small jars hold a variety of dried herbs.
12. A small strip of leather tied in a loop.
13. This small iron potion vial is labelled "Dragon Blood”. The vial feels slightly warm to the touch.
14. This worn brass key is tarnished with great age.
15. Two tiny clay statuettes depict sitting bloodhounds.
16. A small silver mirror of fine make lies wrapped in a strip of black velvet.
17. This neatly folded square of red fabric has a tiny embroiled spider d e c o r a t i n g o n e corner.
18. This worn small c l a y m o d e l depicts a multis t e p p e d ziggurat. It has clearly seen much use as several of its corners are chipped.
19. A wooden box holds several chunks of quartz, rock crystal, granite and several other types of rock.
20. These three small forked metal rods are inscribed with the name of a different plane of existence. 





## MINOR MAGICAL EFFECTS 



1. Small motes of multi-coloured light float near the ceiling. They gently bob in the air currents and swirl about wildly when someone passes beneath them.
2. The temperature in parts of the tower is either much hotter or colder than the others for no apparent reason.
3. A faintly glowing translucent mist hugs the floor. Those staring into the mist for too long are suddenly overwhelmed by a sensation of falling, which only ends when they shut their eyes.
4. Doors open silently when a sentient comes within fivefoot and close when it moves away. The tower's resident can override this effect and command the doors to remain closed or open.
5. Gravity is subtly different in the tower. Lightweight objects—weighing less than one pound—if left unattended, sometimes begin to float of their own accord. (Small micro-pockets of zero gravity float through the tower due to the erosion between the planes of existence existing in and about the structure).
6. The tower has no mundane decorations such as paintings, tapestries or other decorative wall hangings. Instead, beautifully created illusions of otherworldly places—alien vistas, strange cities and so forth—decorate the walls. Careful observation of the decorations reveals several have tiny moving features such as clouds, people, wandering monsters and so on.
7. Key pieces of furniture—the wizard's favourites such as his desk, chair and so on—are animate and can move around at his command.
8. Residual magic covers some sections of the floor. Characters stepping on such locations leave faintly glowing footprints that fade after an hour.
9. Faint music fills the tower; the type and style of music are dependent on the wizard's mood.
10. Glowing, intangible runes float through the air. They pop out of existence when they come into contact with anything solid.
11. On occasion, insubstantial, ghostly figures float through the tower; they pay no attention to its inhabitants or guests. The figures seem to be of a haughty, cruel-faced race of humans who wear clothes of strange cut.
12. A blast of hot air—like a desert gale-every now and then— rushes through the tower.
13. Gently glowing green mist fills this part of the tower. The mist reduces visibility to about five-foot and resists mundane attempts to dissipate it.
14. Heatless flames writhe about metal balls hung from the ceiling in each room, providing light. A command word causes the flames to extinguish (or ignite).
15. The sound of gently falling rain echoes throughout the tower, no matter the weather outside.
16. Doors within the tower are crafted from some kind of super-hard transparent crystal. Inside each room, the doors are flanked by curtains that can be pulled across for privacy.
17. Every room in the tower has a black ceiling. Chaotic swirls of multi-hued light writhe across their surfaces in a never-ending cascade of colour.
18. Invisible magical servants move about the tower tidying up and cleaning. The resident wizard abhors mess and so has created these semi-sentient invisible servants to indulge his lust for cleanliness and order.
19. The fur of any animal entering the tower becomes charged with static electricity and stands up on end. This does not hurt the animal but can give it a somewhat comical appearance.
20. Characters in the tower can become affected by the thinness of the boundaries between planes at this point of the multiverse. Occasionally, such characters are assailed by glimpses of these other planes and their inhabitants. The visions happen suddenly and without warning and can be disconcerting. With practice, the visions can be controlled, and the viewer can use this strange effect as a limited form of scrying magic. 

## STRANGE SOUNDS 



1. Perceptive characters detect the sound of barely audible muttering in a harsh, otherworldly language. The sound is so faint, though, they cannot make out more than a few words.
2. Many small holes pierce the tower's outer walls; when the wind is stronger than a breeze, this creates a whining sound that rises and falls as gusts batter the structure.
3. Footsteps sound in a random direction, but investigations reveal the relevant area to be empty.
4. A perceptive character detects the faint sound of scrabbling claws on stone.
5. Barely audible crying or sobbing comes to the party's ears; it comes from an unknown source.
6. A high pitch buzzing sounds suddenly begins. No matter the characters' actions, it increases in pitch for 30 seconds before abruptly ceasing.
7. A low humming—seemingly coming from the tower's foundations— becomes apparent to the characters' ears. It continues for 20 minutes before slowly fading away.
8. A single, loud chime suddenly rings out. The sound echoes through the tower. 





# WRECKED SHIP 







## ON DECK 



1. Rigging whips through the air, snapping in the wind and striking out at the characters. Unwary explorers may be hit by a swinging pulley or entangled in the many lengths of rope and nets.
2. A mast has snapped and collapsed onto the deck creating a tangled web of sails and rigging. Explorers traversing the mess may fall into the unsteady pile and be injured by the splintered bits of hull or fall through it all into the hold below.
3. Water that has splashed over the ship's side pools at one end of the slanted deck. Silt, sand and debris fill the pool which may conceal an aquatic creature washed on board by the surging waters.
4. Cargo and splintered timbers have washed into a pile against the ship's rail. Beneath the detritus lie the remains of two of the crew. (Maybe one is an important person, such as the quartermaster, who holds useful keys to the hold and various cabins).
5. The wreck has split in two. The splintered parts have come to rest a short distance from each other. A tangled mess of rigging and splinters of shattered wood connect the two. One part of the wreck may be stable, stuck on rocks, while the other still floats in the turgid waters.
6. The ship lurches suddenly to one side throwing explorers about. This could happen due to sudden swells of water striking the wreck or the resting ship shifting on its precarious perch. The threat of the ship sinking further may add a sense of urgency and a time limit to the characters' exploration.
7. One side of the hull was torn apart, leaving open cabins exposed over several decks. Adventurers could climb down the open sides to reach the ship's interior. The area may contain signs of creatures attacking the ship or the crew fleeing through the newly created holes.
8. A splintered fallen section of the mainmast has pinned a crew member to the deck in a bloody mess. The bloodcovered mast descends through all the decks and punctures the hull and blood leaks out into the surrounding water. The crew member could still be alive, leaving the rescuers with a difficult decision to make.
9. Waves spilling over the side may knock the characters over and wash unsteady explorers towards the open hatch of the slowly filling hold. The weight of the water speeds up the ship's descent to its watery grave.
10. Trunks and crates thrown around by the impact of the crash, and the steadily swelling waves, smash into the explorers or block hatches and doorways, hindering exploration. More cargo is tied down around the ship, but this may break free due to the repeated impact of the sea striking the wreck. 





## MINOR EVENTS 



1. Seabirds fly out of a nearby hatchway, squawking noisily. They were feeding on a disgusting pile of remains, possibly a crew member or a creature that attacked the ship. Being tenacious (and hungry) they return when the characters move on.
2. Broken decking collapses under the feet of explorers trapping them in razor-sharp snares or sending them crashing into the deck below.
3. A bloodstained boarding axe is embedded in a cabin door. There are no clues as to why it is there or to whom it belongs. Perhaps someone was trying to rescue another or a rivalry was being settled.
4. The door to a water-filled room is jammed shut. Watertight, it explodes outwards with a torrential rush of water if forced open, washing explorers down the corridor. The water may contain trapped crew members or treasures which are swept out of sight and further into the ship by the cascading waters.
5. The wreck rests at an odd angle which makes moving faster than normal difficult. Unattended objects slid towards the lower parts of the ship forming unstable piles and the lower parts of the ship filled with water first.
6. A broken lantern spilt here setting fire to the timbers and burning several holes in the decking and walls before being extinguished. Holes in the timbers may provide insight into nearby rooms or decks below. Some of the oil may still be there ready to be ignited.
7. A cabin doorway has been smashed in from the outside. The contents of the cabin are scattered around and ruined. Investigations reveal spattered blood on the walls and evidence the cabin was hastily searched.
8. A seagull or carrion bird is trapped in a corridor below decks. It flees explorers by heading further into the ship. Cawing noisily whenever approached it flees and may alert others to the explorers' presence.
9. The jagged ends of broken timber partially block the corridor. They must be squeezed past carefully to avoid damage from the splintered ends. Careful inspection may provide clues to the cause of the ship's demise.
10. The gentle rocking of the wreck rings the ship's bell-like a fading heartbeat. This may alert others to the presence of the ship (if it lies in a fog bank) and could warn them of intruders should it be suddenly silenced.
11. A broken spar suspended high above the deck finally breaks sending it crashing down. It crushes anyone unlucky enough to be under it before plunging through the deck. Explorers below may be surprised by the mast suddenly appearing in their midst; the only warning is the sound of it crashing through the decks above.
12. The ship's wheel is locked in position, either tied off by rope or something more sinister like the bloodied blade of a broken sword or the bound corpse of the captain.
13. A section of the ship creaks and groans loudly for some time before breaking off and coming to rest a short distance away. This could leave certain areas of the ship difficult to reach or strand characters on different parts of the ship.
14. Water flowing from other areas of the ship collects here, slowly filling the area. The longer it takes explorers to reach this area, the deeper the water will be. A trapped aquatic creature may lurk below the surface seeking a way to escape or a trapped member of the crew could be about to drown. Opening doors to other areas allows the water to drain away.
15. The spar of a mast breaks its tethers suddenly and swings across the ship in a broad arc. Smaller creatures watch it sail over their heads as it crashes into larger creatures who are unaware or too slow to avoid it. Anyone hit by the spar could be knocked overboard or into an open hatch.
16. The shifting of the ship spills an abandoned bucket of greasy kitchen slop across the deck making the footing slippery and dangerous. The smell may attract scavengers to the area, particularly noisy seabirds.
17. A sail's rigging collapses dropping the canvas over the decks, potentially trapping the characters beneath it. Characters entangled under it may be in danger from rising waters or from more falling rigging and timber.
18. A large swarm of crabs (crayfish in freshwater) has entered the wreck through rents in the hull and are now feeding on the crew's remains. Not only is the stench nauseating but the swarm may attack anyone disturbing their meal.
19. Barrels of damaged oil (or pitch used to seal the ship's hull) have spilt across a large area. They are a fire hazard and make areas slippery. Alternatively, if the oil floats on the water it soaks into the clothing of people wading through it (making them more flammable than usual).
20. Debris below the surface of the water block further progress. The characters must swim under the blockage to pass it or carefully swim through small gaps to the areas beyond. Care must be taken to avoid snagging loose clothing or injury by passing by. 





## BELOW DECKS: CABINS 



1. Silvery wind chimes hanging in the doorway give way to reveal an officer's cabin. Cold, damp uniforms hang mouldering on the walls, and a well-read book lies on the unmade bed. A quick read reveals the book tells the epic story of Vilimzair Aralivar the World's Greatest Ever Bard and Legendary Pirate Captain.
2. A communal cabin has six perfectly made bunks on two walls. Clothing and a small number of personal items neatly fill the lockers at the end of each bed (in stark contrast to the condition of the rest of the ship).
3. The interior of this room is burnt and blackened, leaving the paint blistered and peeling away from the walls. Vaguely shaped piles of charcoal and ash are all that remains of this room's contents.
4. The door to this room is jammed shut, the twisted timbers of the ship prevent easy access. If forced open, the room beyond is missing; a gaping hole in the side of the ship reveals only the sea beyond. The carcass of a shark or whale floats nearby and is already a source of food for a variety of other sea life.
5. Flickering orange and purple glyphs glow in the darkness, offering glimpses of a wizard's jumbled quarters. Debris is strewn across the floor; a variety of spell components such as bat guano and spider webs are mixed in amongst the chaos.
6. Two hammocks are twisted up amongst the remains of broken furniture that has pulled free from its fittings. A leather pouch still hanging on a hook contains an extensive collection of pristine seashells.
7. An enormous rock has staved in the side of the ship, allowing water to pour into the cabin. An examination of the rock reveals strange etchings and runes over much of its surface.
8. An oaken writing desk has survived whatever destroyed the rest of the furniture in this room. An unsigned letter is pinned to it, addressed to someone's fiancee. The address indicates a home in a nearby city.
9. This cabin has been ruined by whatever damaged the ship. Anything of value has been shattered, crushed or is saturated by seawater, though a portrait of a family hanging on a wall is intact and dry.
10. Relatively untouched by the disaster that has befallen the ship, a small shrine lies on the floor surrounded by roughly carved wooden figurines scattered around it. A decomposing corpse, its face covered by a wet sheet, lies in a bed adjacent to the shrine.
11. The rotting corpse of a sailor lies below a heavy fallen shelf; the man's back has been broken.
12. A book lies on the floor. The book contains drawings of birds, different kinds of sea creatures and the like. The quality of the pictures is excellent. 

### THINGS TO FIND 



1. Hidden beneath a sea-chair is the captain's logbook, detailing the vessel's daily heading and speed, and such things as the weather. Even without maps, an experienced navigator should be able to retrace the ship's final journey.
2. An exotic bird curses repeatedly in the Common language from within its gilded cage. Its bright plumage hints at an exotic jungle origin. There is no sign of the bird's owner or clue as to why it looks so well fed.
3. High-quality maps are kept safe within well-used cases. Although most show easily identifiable locations and coastlines, one is notably different, showing an unknown land. That map is drawn in a distinctly different style and language and appears much older than the others.
4. A bone instrument takes pride of place on a wall, displayed for all to see. If played correctly it sounds almost unreal, as if the tones are coming from a great distance. Strangely, an echo reaches the characters' ears after a brief delay.
5. A portrait of a woman fills a detailed silver frame. If the picture is examined, the woman's mouth begins to move, as if she is trying to whisper a message, though she makes no sound.
6. A search reveals a ship somehow placed inside a glass bottle, floating in water that moves as if real. A large hole is staved in the model's side and is disturbingly similar to the damage to the ship the characters are exploring.
7. A large dingy is suspended by ropes at the aft of the ship. It looks in good condition, and the mechanism holding it in place is easy to operate. Stowed aboard the dingy are four oars, a brass bell and some thick blankets.
8. A heavy brass telescope lies within a well-padded mahogany box. The design is strange; twisting one end of the tube controls the focal distance, which mysteriously appears to stretch over the horizon.
9. Scratching sounds give way to movement and then purring. The ship's cat, a ginger tom that appears to have seen more than its fair share of scrapes, slips into view. It happily wraps itself around anyone it sees. A pile of rat bones lies nearby.
10. Attached to a crane and winch at the rear of the vessel is a huge glass bubble. Two chairs are fixed within, and a rope runs up to a pair of tubes in the top of the bubble. The tubes continue up to the crane and are attached to a pump and a bell. An expert engineer might recognise the (primitive) diving bell, and suggest how to operate it. Sadly, it is little more than a deathtrap. 
11. The ship's overturned pay chest lies against one wall. An inviting pool of silver and gold coins spills from the chest's partially open lid.
12. A rat scurries past the party, with something shiny and bloody in its mouth. If the characters catch the rat, they find it was carrying a severed finger encircled by a fat ring of beaten gold. The ring bears the signet of a leaping dolphin. 

## BELOW DECKS: COMMUNAL AREAS 



1. Water sloshes at knee height in the ship's mess. Wooden plates and utensils float on the water's surface whilst a small bright blue octopus watches the characters cautiously from atop a table.
2. The galley is ruined. Broken pots and plates clutter the floor, and damp, ruined foodstuffs fill the cupboards. A thorough search might reveal some hardtack or rations that are still edible in a closed cupboard.
3. This was a store of some kind, though it looks like it has been recently emptied of anything useful. All that remains are torn nets and broken tools. A trapdoor leads to the bilges.
4. Water surges through the door as the characters open it, slowly draining from a store full of sailcloth, rope, wooden planks and tar. If dried, these materials could be used to effect some repairs.
5. The map room stinks of damp, decaying paper. Damaged cases and open barrels alike hold waterdamaged maps on both paper and papyrus. Most fall apart when touched, but perhaps some can be saved.
6. A well-stocked, mostly intact bar—likely for the officers or passengers fills this cabin. It holds nothing particularly expensive or unusual but does there is enough alcohol to keep explorers happy for a while.
7. The brig contains two cells, comprising rusting steel bars secured to the ceiling and floor. A rotting corpse lies in one, its clothes in tatters. The lock to the cell shows signs of damage from a heavy object, and scratches on the wooden floor appear to be made by fingernails.
8. This room is scarcely more than a large cupboard and holds much fishing equipment: nets, rods, line and even a couple of harpoons. Most are in poor condition but are still usable.
9. A mysterious unknown force holds back the water partfilling this room. A corpse wearing decaying robes of indeterminate colour floats near the ceiling, barely visible through the thick seaweed choking the room. A close examination shows the seaweed is growing directly from the wooden floor.
10. This cabin contains medical tools and rotting bandages floating in the knee-high water. A sturdy chair, complete with leather restraints, lies against one wall. A transparent figure dressed in a bloody uniform beckons to the first in a queue of ghostly figures leading through the door. The ghostly surgeon performs gruesome surgeries on each patient—all of whom writhe in pain before obviously expiring. 

### THINGS TO FIND 



1. A handaxe with a bloody handle lies discarded on the floor, near a pile of splintered wood and scraps of rope.
2. A stout sea chest lies on its back. The lid is shut, but not locked, and contains several weeks of hardtack biscuits and four large bulging waterskins.
3. An oiled heavy cloak with a deep cowl hangs from a hook. The cloak has an inner liner of coarse, dark fur. It is both warm and waterproof. A pair of worn knee-high leather boots stand below the cloak.
4. A bulging sack lies on the floor. The sack holds a sailor's worldly goods and was dropped when the crew tried to abandon the ship. The sack's contents include clothes, a scrimshaw shark's tooth cut into a wave pattern and other odds and ends along with the sailor's life savings: 12 gp, 47 sp and 142 cp. 





## IN THE HOLD 



1. Ornate wooden chests are fastened to the deck and kept closed by chains and elaborate padlocks. If forced open, they reveal their contents: brightly-coloured delicate silks, ruined by seawater.
2. The smell emanating from these barrels reveals their contents before they are opened: salted fish, long past the point where any might be edible. A leather pouch is hidden amongst the stinking fish, but the powder it holds is as ruined as the fish.
3. Two crates lie on the deck, having broken free from their bindings. Their hinges are rusted shut but can be forced with some difficulty. Inside are a variety of farming implements, well-preserved by a coating of oil.
4. Dozens of neatly folded white uniforms are wrapped in waxed canvas packages. Each has the name of a mercenary company woven into the fabric.
5. Metal cages line the wall. Each holds a motionless animal wearing a collar with a leather name tag. If a tag is touched and the name read aloud, the animal slowly begins to stir, as if waking from a long sleep.
6. A locked door at the back of the hold gives way to a dark area with a stench not unlike a city sewer. Tiny bunks line the walls from floor to ceiling, each with a collar and short chain running from the end of the bed. Most are empty, but three corpses lie here—mute evidence of the captain's business.
7. Separated from the rest of the cargo by strong metal bars, several strongboxes are stacked neatly and tied down with stout ropes. Each strongbox is locked, and inscriptions on the front of each describe the objects within—bars of valuable metals, rare spices and exotic wood fill the boxes.
8. A strange barrel-like device takes up the centre of the hold. Standing nearly 10 ft. high, several bizarre appendages extrude from the main body, ending in hooks or pincers. The device can be accessed by a heavy metal trapdoor and secured from either side by a wheel. Inside there are dozens of dials, buttons and levers; none seem to do anything.
9. The hold is full of lumber; heavy logs run the length of the hold secured by strong leather straps. One pile of wood has broken free from its bindings, leaving part of the hold nearly inaccessible behind the jumbled, unsteady pile.
10. This hold is empty and oddly quiet. Even the movement of the ship seems diminished. Shadows flit from one dark corner to another and if watched reveal an image of another place, with a busy crew working to unload a heavy cargo. It is impossible to tell if this image was a hallucination, a vision, or a glimpse into another realm.
